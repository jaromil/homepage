<h1>The Weaver Birds</h1>    
<p class="image"><img src="images/dyne-big.png" alt=""></p>

<h2>Hackers spinning the Dharma wheel</h2>

<p class="first">You are welcome to join the new wheel spin of our history.</p>

<p>This document is an open,  collective and still in fieri expression of
a large network  of hackers and the beliefs  motivating their actions.
We aim to compile a  programmatic, visionary and inclusive document to
reclaim space in  societies for the GNU generations,  proposing a plan
to be shared and that already is being shared by many.</p>

<p>The  dyne.org hackers network  has become  8 years  old this  year. Of
course, this text doesn't just talk about &quot;us&quot;. Being an open network,
we are  including multiple  contexts around the  world, with  which we
share mutual help; as with  our free software development activity and
the sharing of on-line and  on-site spaces.  This document talks about
our dreams, as they slowly but steadily are becoming reality.</p>

<p>For all this  we are infinitely grateful to the  <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU project</a>, that let
us  discover  how  to get  hold  of  knowledge,  take control  of  the
architecture we live in and start building a new planet :)</p>



<h2>Dharma youth</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>The only people  for me are the  mad ones, the ones who  are mad to
live, mad  to talk, mad to  be saved, desirous of  everything at the
same time, the  ones who never yawn or say  a commonplace thing, but
burn, burn, burn, like  fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like
spiders across the stars.</em> (Jack Kerouac, Dharma Bums)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First let's declare who  we are: after 8 years we are  able to trace a
common   denominator  among   the  people   active  in   our  network,
interconnected by a nomadic approach to development and life.</p>

<p>We are young dreamers, as we often like to stir limitations and invent
different  models to  learn, communicate,  share and  live  than those
proposed by the societies where we are caged.</p>

<p>We  have  in common  that  we survived  out  of  the commonplaces,  we
cultivated  our thoughts  and  sharing methods,  knowledge and  tools,
keeping them out of any box.</p>

<p>This  is the  time in  our  history in  which we'll  speak with  young
voices, when we are moving some  crucial steps on which we'll base our
architectures,  hopefully mixing the  inner with  the outer,  the Ying
with the Yang.</p>

<p>Some of us  are nomads, some settle in different  places time to time,
some live in the same  marginal neighbourhoods of the world where they
were born, some  are working for multinational IT  companies, some are
riding bicycles all  around the world, some are  lecturing in schools,
some  are   exhibiting  in  art  galleries  and   some  are  squatting
houses. And  yes, probably you are one  of those, or you  have been in
contact with us, at least once.</p>

<p>What we  are proposing here is a  new model and we  finally acquired a
practical  vision  to  develop   it  in  harmony  with  our  different
environments. Please continue reading if  you like to discover why and
how.</p>



<h2>Freedom of Creativity</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>The growth of the  network rendered the non-propertarian alternative
even  more  practical.  What  scholarly  and  popular writing  alike
denominate as  a thing  (&quot;the Internet&quot;) is  actually the name  of a
social condition: the  fact that everyone in the  network society is
connected directly,  without intermediation, to  everyone else.  The
global  interconnection of networks  eliminated the  bottleneck that
had required a centralized  software manufacturer to rationalize and
distribute the  outcome of individual  innovation in the era  of the
mainframe.</em> (Eben Moglen)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Free software  (as in  &quot;Libre&quot; and Free  and Open Source,  referred as
FOSS)  is  a   set  of  principles  endorsed  by   the  Free  Software
Foundation<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>  (FSF),  envisioning   a  new  model  for  distribution,
development and marketing of immaterial goods.  While recommending you
to have  a look at  the philosophy pages  published by the  FSF, we'll
highlight some implications which are  most important for us by making
our activities possible and motivating them.</p>

<p>FOSS  implies an  economic  model based  on  collaboration instead  of
competition, fitting in the  fields of academic research where sharing
of knowledge is fundamental ,  and development where the joint efforts
of  different  developers can  be  better  sustained when  distributed
across  various nodes.  In  this regard  we  like to  quote John  Nash
(Mathematics Nobel  in 1994)  saying that &quot;the  best result  will come
from everybody  in the  group doing what's  best for himself,  and the
group&quot;.</p>

<p>Imagine then  that all creations re-produced  in this way  can also be
sold freely by anyone in each context: this opens up an horizon of new
business  models  that are  local,  avoiding globalized  exploitation,
still sharing a global pool of knowledge useful to everyone.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in the  fields of education we believe  that the inherent
independence of FOSS from commercial influences is crucial in order to
empower students  with a  knowledge that they  really own,  not making
them  dependent  from merchants  owning  their  creations by  imposing
licenses on the tools they've learned.</p>

<p>And  lastly just  consider,  and feel  free  to invent  more on  these
tracks, the  impact of Free and  Open Source models in  fields such as
communication, social networking,  games, media and...  evolution.</p>

<p>To elaborate more reflections on these issues up to the formulation of
&quot;policy recommendations&quot; for those that are currently in power, a good
starting point is offered by a recent collective effort we joined: the
<a href="http://www.fcforum.org">Free Culture Forum</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Here is where  the difference between free software  and open source
starts to matter.  Open source focuses on new model for development.
Free software is not interested in how the program is developed.  We
are   interested   in   the   ethics   of   how   the   program   is
distributed. (Richard M. Stallman)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we want to liberate our minds and those of the ones who will come.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a class="footnum" name="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1.</a> see <a href="http://www.fsf.org">http://www.fsf.org</a></p>


<h2>No nationhood</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>Per far che  i secoli tacciano di quel  Trattato<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> che trafficò la
mia patria, insospettì  le nazioni e scemò dignità  al tuo nome.</em> (A
Bonaparte liberatore, Ugo Foscolo, 1778-1827)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>One Planet, One Nation</em> (Public Enemy)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our homelands are displaced and sometimes very different, difficult to
be put  in contact with  the boundaries given  by nations. In  fact we
think that nation  states should come to an end,  for the borders they
impose  aren't matching with  our aspirations  and current  ability to
relate with each other.</p>

<p>During the few years of our  lives we have been taught to interact and
describe  ourselves  within  national   schemes,  but  the  only  real
boundaries were  the differences between our languages,  while we have
learned to cross them.</p>

<p>From our national  histories we mostly inherited fears  and anger, but
with this  network we  have learned  how to bury  them, as  they don't
belong to  us anymore.  What's left is  a just  a problem that  can be
solved:   we  will  stop   representing  us   as  part   of  different
nations. Even  if we could, we  don't intend to build  our own nation,
nor to propose to you a new social contract, but to cross all of these
borders as a unique networked planet, to start a new cartography.</p>

<p>We have a planet! and it is young enough to heal the scars left by the
last  centuries of  war, imperialism,  colonisation  and prevarication
that  left most  people  around us  cultivating  differences and  fake
identities represented by flags and nationalist propaganda.</p>

<p>We  aren't  claiming  to  open  the  borders  to  the  speculation  of
multinationals, since we are well aware this can be a rhetoric used by
“neo-liberalist” interests to tramp  over the autonomy of developing
countries. The Contextual  integrity<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> of different social ecosystems
needs  to be respected,  but still  as of  today the  national borders
haven't succeeded in preserving it.</p>

<p>With some exceptions, most of the national programs and cultural funds
we agreed to  work with were intending each of us  would dress a flag,
as  we  were  recruited in  a  decadent  game  of national  pride  and
competition,  with  an agenda  of  cultural,  economical and  physical
domination, tracing all our movements, assimilating them to leviathans
that are playing their last violent moves in a chess game for which we
are just seamless pieces.</p>

<p>This  doesn't make  sense  anymore  to our  generation,  we refuse  to
identify  with the governments  holding our  passports, while  we look
forward  to relating  with each  other on  the basis  of  dialogue and
exchange, approaches  and architectures that can  be imagined globally
and developed locally,  in an open way the channels  that let us speak
to you right now.</p>

<p>Therefore  we  declare  <strong>the  end  of nations</strong>,  as  our  generation  is
connected by  a way more complicated intersection  of wills, destinies
and, most importantly, problems to be solved.</p>

<h2>Networked cities</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>Creo que con  el tiempo mereceremos no tener  gobiernos.</em> (Jorge Luis
Borges, 1899-1986)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naturally  our  cartography draws  connections  among  nodes, hubs  of
intelligence  that are  closer in  cyber  space than  in the  physical
one.  In the  last century  we have  learned how  we can  share music,
lyrics, stories  and images, since  for a few  decades we are  able to
copy them with marginal costs across the whole world.</p>

<p>This let us relate to each other with an outreach that is amplified by
the density of our living  environments, the urban spaces that somehow
offered enough  gaps for our agency.  Those who pretend  to govern our
living are  now busy in  controlling those voids,  as every tree  in a
public square  represents an  obstacle for their  cameras, omnipresent
eyes patronising our evolution.</p>

<p>We found shelter in the  ancestral practices of trance<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>, opening the
doors  of our  perception to  the unknown,  resonating our  own bones,
enhancing the  agility of our  tongues to follow  the hip hop  flow of
radical  thoughts,  skating  over  the universe  we  are  constrained,
painting fantasy over the imposed  walls of our cities, jumping higher
to join the loose ends of our parkours.</p>

<p>These practices are now among all  of our cities<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.5" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>, seeded by our own
need  to evolve,  to influence  a  governance that  doesn't listen  to
us. Some kids  turn into a dark army of vengeance,  some lose faith in
the future, some fall in the virtual loopholes offered by the magnetic
startups of the dot.com boom. We need to offerourselves an alternative
to this hopeless  conflict and the first step is  to build a narrative
that respects all choices, that doesn't neglect suffering.</p>

<p>All this creativity and despair is shared among our cities, stuffed by
unnecessary needs and mirages of success of the &quot;creative industries&quot;,
while we already  elaborate a concentric vision that  is linked to the
density of our lives and the cultural flow of our errant knowledge.</p>

<p>Therefore we  declare the  birth of a  <strong>planet of  networked cities</strong><sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.6" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>,
spiral architectures of living swirling above our heads and across our
fingers,  as they  evolve in  a  common practice  of displacement  and
re-conjunction, joining the loose ends of our future.</p>

<p>Our plan is  simple and our project is already in  motion. In fact, if
you look  around yourself, you will  already find <em>us</em>  close. While the
current economical and political systems face the difficulty of hiding
their  own incoherence,  we  are able  to  implement their  principles
better and, most importantly, we are elaborating new ones.</p>

<p>We are reclaiming the infrastructure, the liberty to adapt them to our
needs, our right to property  without strings attached, the freedom to
confront ideas without any  manipulative mediation, peer to peer, face
to face, city to city, human to human.</p>

<p>The possibility  to grow local communities  and economies, eliminating
globalised  monopolies  and  living  up  from our  own  creations,  is
there. We are filling the empty  spaces left in our own cities, we are
setting our own desires and we are collectively able to satisfy them.</p>

<p>Furthermore, some of us are  seeking contacts with the lower strata of
societies, to share  a growing autonomy: as much  they are excluded by
the society they serve, that much  they are close to freedom, while it
is clear that autonomy is the solution to present crisis.</p>

<p>These marginal  communities were the villagers who,  mostly because of
rural poverty, could no longer  survive on agriculture, as well as the
migrants and refugees  who had to escape their  birth places, or never
had a homeland. They came to  the city and they found neither work nor
shelter.  They created their  own jobs  out of  the cynical  logics of
capitalism,  mostly  in  refuse  recycling.  They  look  ugly  to  the
minorities in power, while most architects and urban planners unjustly
call  their  shelter  &quot;illegal  settlements&quot;. Some  of  them  organise
themselves to gain power with solidarity, and those are the squatters.</p>

<p>During the past decades we have  learnt to enhance our own autonomy in
the urban contexts<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.7" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>, diving  across the different contexts composing
the cities,  disclosing the inner structure of  their closed networks,
developing a  different texture made of relationships  that no company
can buy.</p>

<p>We are the  <strong>Weaver Birds</strong>, Burung-Burung Manyar<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.8" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>, we  share our nests
in a  network, we flow as  the river of the  spontaneous settlement of
Code  in  Yogyakarta<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.9" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup>,  the   gypsy  neighbourhood  of  Sulukule  in
Instanbul, the Chaos Computer Club, all the hacklabs across the world,
the self-organised  squatters in Amsterdam Berlin  Barcelona and more,
the hideouts of  2600 and all the other  temporary hacker spaces where
our future, and your future, is being homebrewed.</p>

<p>This  document  is just  the  start for  a  new  course, outlining  an
analysis that  is shared among a  growing number of  young hackers and
artists, nourished by their  autonomy and knowledge. Our hacker spaces
are quickly proliferating as we  don't need to build more space rather
than penetrate existing empty space, we are highly adaptive and we aim
at connecting  rather than separating, at being  inclusive rather than
exclusive, at being effective rather than acquiring status.</p>

<p>To those  who feel threatened  we ask: do  not resist us, for  we will
last longer than  you; and leave us space, for you  don't use it while
we do. Do it for the good of all of us, because we are your own kids.</p>

<h2>Horizontal media</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>Whoever controls the media -the images- controls the culture.</em> (Allen
Ginsberg, 1926-1997</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our concern  about freedom  in media is  serious, the  current urgency
justifies all our acts of  rebellion, as they become necessary. One of
our main activities is patiently weaving the threads for open networks
that put us  all in contact. But greedy  national regimes and criminal
organisations threaten us as if they can avoid their fascist nature to
be known,  while opportunist  provokers use our  open grounds  to have
granted the right to offend and generate more wars.</p>

<p>About media we certainly accumulated enough knowledge to trace a clear
path for our  development, as we have been doing  since the early days
of our existence: we are active in implementing the liberties that the
digital age grants us. This intellectual freedom is very important for
the  development of  humanity, for  its  capacity to  analyse its  own
actions, to weave its faith in harmony.</p>

<p>Our  plan is to  keep on  developing more  on-site and  on-line public
space for  discussion, following  a <strong>decentralised pattern</strong>  that grants
access to most people on  our planet. We created tools for independent
media,  to multiply  the voices  in protection  of common  visions, to
avoid that a few media  tycoons take over democracies, as is happening
in many different places of this world.</p>

<p>We are aware of the limits of the present implementation of democracy:
while  they  are  busy  celebrating  their own  success  over  archaic
regimes,  these systems  stopped updating  their own  architecture and
have fallen in control of new enemies which they cannot even recognise
anymore.</p>

<p>The  solution we  propose  is simple:  maximise  the possibilities  to
recycle  existing  media infrastructures,  open  as  many channels  as
possible,   free  the   airwaves,  let   communication  flow   in  its
multiplicity, avoid any mono-directional  use of it, give everyone the
possibility to  run a  radio or  TV station for  it's own  digital and
physical neighbours, following an organic pattern that will modularise
the  sharing of sense  and let  ideas propagate  in a  horizontal, non
hierarchical way.</p>

<p>If these media architectures will be linked with education models that
foster  tolerance we  have hope  to  accelerate the  evolution of  our
planet and grant protection to the minorities that are populating it.</p>





<h2>Freedom of identity</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">If you want peace of mind, do not find fault with others. Rather see
your own faults. Learn to make  the whole world your own.  No one is
a stranger  my child: this whole  World is your  own!  (Sarada Devi,
Gahanananda, 1920)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We believe  that current governmental efforts of  biometric control by
governments,  private data  mining  operated by  companies and  public
schools watching  over students activity, profiling  programs that are
targeting people worldwide are a crime against humanity.</p>

<p>Each of those  efforts are not taking into  careful consideration what
can be done when dictatorial  regimes take control of such systems. In
fact,  this already  happened as  half a  century ago  when  the first
action  of the Nazi  was numbering  people and  labelling them  with a
symbol   marking  their  biological   ethnicities  (as   biometry  can
nowadays).</p>

<p>Conscious  of  the  lack  of  responsibility  of  current  governments
worldwide, we  will oppose with  all means necessary their  efforts to
number and  control all people in  the name of a  safe and unreachable
security that, as we hackers can demonstrate, cannot be  enforced by
such means.</p>

<p>As hackers we are well  conscious of information flows and how several
leaks  in   the  digital  domain  are   actually  disclosing  personal
information of large  amounts of people worldwide. We  do believe that
people shouldn't be numbered and included in databases, which probably
is what still differentiates governments from operating systems merely
suppressing the processes that aren't optimised for their tasks.</p>

<p>Our  generation includes  a  large critical  mass  concerned on  these
issues, let  it be proof the  recent success of  <em>Freedom not Fear</em><sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>,
while an entertaining and poetical description of our feelings is also
depicted by the movie Gattaca<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>Because  this   New  Order  of   ours  is  a  military   order,  an
authoritarian order,  commando style, there is  no education.  There
is only instruction, a mere taming experience.</em> (<em>Romo Mangun</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As  privatisation of  educational structures  progresses,  the academy
assumes a corporate  and business mindset, while we  assist to a shift
of the educational mission in society from <em>inclusive</em> to <em>exclusive</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The  semantic nucleus  (Sinn)  of the  word  &quot;Economy&quot; has  remained
almost invariant  and that has permitted  to extend the  word to new
denotations (Bedeutung).  This phenomenon is somehow similar to what
has  happened in our  days to  the term  <em>Enterprise</em> which,  with the
consensus of the majority  of interested subjects, has been extended
to contexts  indicated by the term <em>University</em>,  which originally had
nothing to do with it (Agamben, 2007)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The  influential  play of  industries  has  permeated most  academical
disciplines,  in particular  regarding the  adoption  of technologies.
The  choice of educators  has become  biased by  logics of  short term
profit, rather than <strong>Solid Knowledge</strong>.</p>


<p>On the other hand, notions are rapidly becoming universally available.
<em>Heuristic</em>, <em>maieutic</em> and <em>infrastructure</em> functions provided by academies
are  best  satisfied  by  the  global  action  of  the  free  software
communities'  <strong>horizontally</strong> sharing  methods,  experiences and  working
implementations, on distributed and versioned R&amp;D platforms.</p>

<p>As  components   can  be   combined  and  redistributed,   copied  and
modified<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.10" href="#fn.10">10</a></sup>  students  learn a  knowledge  that  is durable,  without
restrictions on  their rights  to produce and  redistribute creations.
This situation  will provide an  advantage for new generations,  as it
does for developing countries.</p>

<p>Media hubs and hacker spaces  constitute a great potential to activate
cultural growth, fulfilling an  educational role that is progressively
lacking in higher schools and universities.</p>

<p>In 1998, during  the first edition of the  hackmeeting<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.11" href="#fn.11">11</a></sup> in Firenze,
its assembly launched the idea of <em>independent universities of hacking</em>,
spawning numerous  hacklabs across  the networked cities,  with annual
meetings that have been taking  place until today in various places in
the south of Europe.  We believe the results of these initiatives have
been  greatly   influential  for   our  own  cultural   and  technical
development, as  they hosted  an errant knowledge  otherwise dispersed
and neglected by the academies,  with the participation of people like
Wau  Holland,  Richard Stallman,  Tetsuo  Kogawa, Andy  Muller-Magoon,
Emmanuel Goldstein and even more collectives and individuals.</p>

<p>With such a short but intense  history behind us we are well motivated
to  continue  developing  our   independent  paths  of  knowledge,  an
auto-didactic  literature that liberates  the students  from corporate
interests  and opens  up an  horizon  of variety  and creativity  that
cannot be envisioned by the most advanced, yet faulty, implementations
of the so called &quot;creative industries&quot;.</p>
