        <h2>Deforestation satellite monitoring</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">An interesting  concern raises up from  an entry posted  on the Google
developer's blog:  <a href="http://blog.google.org/2009/12/seeing-forest-through-cloud.html">monitoring deforestation</a> is now  possible thanks to
wide access  to satellite  imagery.</p>

<p>This  pleasant  situation still  leaves  unanswered  questions on  the
influence  of  popular  perception   on  corporate  governance  -  and
massacres of  indigenous societies, coldly  put. But let's turn  for a
moment our attention to something  else: what is exactly &quot;pleasant&quot; in
this  situation?   what lies  behind  this  novel  enthusiasm for  the
universally available monitoring of anti-social behaviours?</p>

<p>Arguably the essence  of our enthusiasm lies in  the opportunity for a
ubiquitous  feedback  on   issues  commonly  considered  of  universal
importance - at the reach of everyone connected to the Internet.</p>

<p>I really love it, not just related to forests, but to a new image of a
world suddenly  becomes reachable, if not desirable,  when compared to
modern architectures of centralised control.</p>

<p>So why aren't we able to access the cameras in our streets? who should
be  entitled to  watch our  cities? considering  that  satellites were
available to a military elite  already since years and they never used
them to monitor deforestation...</p>

        <h2>English Shellcode</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">Thanks Shammash for pointing  out this witty paper: <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~sam/ccs243-mason.pdf">English Shellcode</a>,
an  effort to  interpret  code into  English  language which  suggests
developments far  beyond its initial  focus on security  research.</p>

<p>The abstract recites:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">History  indicates  that the  security  community  commonly takes  a
divide-and-conquer  approach to  battling malware  threats: identify
the essential and inalienable  components of an attack, then develop
stack protection  and NOP  sled detection. It  comes as  no surprise
then  that  we approach  shellcode  detection  and  prevention in  a
similar  fashion.  However,  the  common belief  that components  of
polymorphic shellcode (e.g., the  decoder) cannot reliably be hidden
suggests a  more implicit and  broader assumption that  continues to
drive  contemporary  research:   namely,  that  valid  and  complete
representations   of  shellcode   are  fundamentally   different  in
structure  than  benign payloads.  While  the  first  tenet of  this
assumption is philosophically undeniable (i.e., a string of bytes is
either shellcode  or it is not),  truth of the latter  claim is less
obvious  if there  exist  encoding techniques  capable of  producing
shellcode with features nearly indistinguishable from non-executable
content.  In this paper,  we challenge the assumption that shellcode
must  conform   to  superficial  and   discernible  representations.
Specifically, we demonstrate a technique for automatically producing
English   Shellcode,  transforming   arbitrary   shellcode  into   a
representation that  is superficially similar to  English prose. The
shellcode is completely self-contained (i.e., it does not require an
external loader and  executes as valid IA32 code)  and can typically
be generated  in under  an hour on  commodity hardware.  Our primary
objective in this  paper is to promote discussion  and stimulate new
ideas  for thinking  ahead  about preventive  measures for  tackling
evolutions in code-injection attacks.</p>

    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">A  mail-out  by the  FSF  today provided  a  nice  round-up about  the
DRM-free campaign this year:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">2009  was the year  that music  DRM died.   But when  Apple's iTunes
store  went DRM-free  on music,  we celebrated  the  victory without
buying the hype:  Apple still uses DRM on  virtually everything else
they sell (movies, TV shows, games, audiobooks, applications, and of
course hardware) - <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/itunes-drm-free">itunes-drm-free</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Ebooks and ebook  readers took off this year, and  so did the threat
of DRM on books.  When Amazon deleted copies of George Orwell's 1984
from hundreds  of people's ebook readers, we  collected thousands of
signatures   from  readers,   authors,   public  intellectuals   and
librarians demanding an end to ebook DRM - <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/amazon1984">amazon1984</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">At the  same time, we praised  and promoted the work  of authors and
publishers who  do the  right thing and  keep their  books DRM-free,
like Harlequin's new publishing  house Carina Press, or the hundreds
of publishers who tagged  their work &quot;drmfree&quot; - <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/carina-drm-free">carina-drm-free</a> and
<a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/blog/1240">blog</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Through all this, Defective by Design  is proud to be the only voice
saying  loud and clear  that there's  no such  thing as  &quot;better&quot; or
&quot;friendlier&quot; DRM.  No matter how many  devices it works  on, or what
&quot;features&quot; it includes  to trick people into accepting  it, DRM robs
us of our basic rights and insults human curiosity&mdash;it needs to go.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">If  you believe  that  the technology  we  use should  be free  from
arbitrary restrictions, the best way  to put that belief into action
is by <a href="https://my.fsf.org/join">becoming an FSF member</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FSF activity  for users and developers rights  really was determinant,
all doe  we still miss to  give artists better  answers and directions
out of babylon.</p>

<p>We're all doing our best. Next  weekend in Barcelona I'll take part in

        <h2>Open Source business models</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">The latest <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">Open Source column  on ZDNet</a> presents the following article
by Dana Blankenhorn &amp; Paula Rooney regarding business models:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Critics are always claiming open source lacks a business model.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">In  fact it's proprietary  software that  is lacking  in imagination.
They have only one business model:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><em>EULA  Ware</em>: Give  me money.   Now go away.  It doesn't  work? Go
away.  You want  your money back? Read your EULA,  and go away. You
want to see the software? Go away.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">This has the virtue of  simplicity.  People pay and you really aren?t
required to  give them anything.  But it lacks  a certain je  ne sais
quoi</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Don't know  what that  is? You must  work for a  proprietary software
company.  (Go away.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Telling people  to pay you and  go away worked for  an amazingly long
time. It sounds  like it shouldn't.  It sounds a  bit like theft. But
software is a  miracle, and for decades EULA Ware  was the only model
there was.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Open  source companies, on  the other  hand, they  have to  use their
imagination.  They  can't feed  people EULA Ware,  so they  must make
money in other ways:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><strong>Support Ware</strong>: Pay us money and we'll support the software. We'll
answer your questions. Or we'll try to. Over the phone, on the Web,
whatever. Pay  us enough  and we'll come  over. Red Hat  likes this
business model.</li>

<li><strong>Product  Ware</strong> : The  software is free,  you just buy the  box it
runs in. Android phones use  this. So do some network routers. It's
number two, but with a bullet.</li>

<li><strong>Cloud Ware</strong> : Our software is  in the clouds now. Pay us for what
it  does. The  money goes  into the  cloud. Later  it will  rain on
us. SugarCRM likes this business model.</li>

<li><strong>Project Ware</strong>  : Need  something done?   We'll do  it  with open
source.  Pay us for our work, and pay us for the project. IBM makes
a ton on this business model.</li>

<li><strong>SaaS Ware</strong> : Our software is SaaSy. You can rent it, by the hour,
by   the   month,  by   the   user.    This   is  wildly   popular.
<a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/office/zoho-office-business-model/1705/">Zoho uses it</a>. So do many other companies.</li>

<li><strong>Ad  Ware</strong> : This is  a free version  of SaaS Ware. You  don't pay
anything, the advertiser pays instead. Heard of The Google? This is
their primary business model. ZDNet also uses this business model.</li>

<li><strong>Sugar Daddy  Ware</strong> : Our software has a  sugar daddy. Firefox has
Google. Eclipse  has IBM. Open Office  has Sun, or it  did. So just
use the stuff. Daddy will provide. We believe in daddy.</li>

<li><strong>Foundation Ware</strong> : Our software  has a foundation. It has lots of
sugar  daddies.  Want to  be  one? Linux  runs  this  way. So  does
Apache. Not to mention Wikipedia.</li>

<li><strong>Beg Ware</strong> : Please give us  money. We know you don?t have to. But
give us  money anyway.  Lots of little  projects use  this business
model. Or pretend to.</li>

<li><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tchotchke">Tchotchke Ware</a>  : Wanna  buy a  t-shirt? How  about  a bumper
sticker? A pen?</li>

<li><strong>Let's Make a Deal Ware</strong> : The programmers who wrote the software
support  it out  of their  own pockets  until they  can  figure out
something.   Wordpress started  this  way.  So  did  Drupal. Go  by
Sourceforge and you?ll find tons of folks still using this business

        <h2>Stubnitz: free Amsterdam?</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">A  petition is  out  to free  the  historical Stubnitz  boat from  the
neo-prohibitionist  wave hitting  the city  of Amsterdam.   This  is a
paradox for such an historical  free culture harbour in Europe, but we
must admit  that Mokum A is  showing signals of decline  since a while
now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">For centuries  Amsterdam was  proud of being  a tolerant  city.  Its
recent <em>vertrutting</em> undermines this.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">MS Stubnitz, 'the  ship of 100 subcultures', is  a representative of
the diverse  and tolerant cultural spirit of  Amsterdam.  For unjust
reasons  the ship  has  been shut  down  by the  City of  Amsterdam,
leaving this  independent cultural hot-spot  and its crew  in limbo:
unable to operate the ship  and unable to leave Amsterdam.  The very
survival of the project is in imminent danger.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Please join  our protest in support  of the Stubnitz,  its crew, and
Amsterdam's <em>onttrutting</em>. *This event  will take place at Dam Square,
this Friday,  13 November  2009, from 15.00  till 18.00h.   A public
discussion on &quot;vertrutting&quot; and  &quot;onttrutting&quot; will take place at de
Balie, this  Saturday, 14 November, from 20.30  till 23.00h. Details
of the program will be announced on <a href="http://tolerantamsterdam.jjmdo.com">tolerantamsterdam.jjmdo.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Please   support  the   Stubnitz   by  <a href="http://www.clanrewired.com/Steun_MS_Stubnitz_in_Amsterdam.html">signing   the  petition</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Details on the illegitimate closure  of the Stubnitz can be found in
the document <a href="http://www.stubnitz.com/0/temp/files/091106Bezwaargronden_bl.pdf">Bezwaargronden</a>&quot; (in Dutch).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">*Save the Stubnitz from capsizing!*</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What  basically happened is  that police  smuggled a  dozen undercover
cops into a Saturday night party  held at the Stubnitz, the boat being
part  of  the  NDSM  cultural  evening  program,  an  industrial  area
converted to  art and  entertainment, subsidised by  creative industry
funds.</p>

<p>The  silent cops  took just  notes during  the party,  emphasising the
&quot;drug  abuse&quot;  happening.  The  day  after,  their anonymously  signed
memorial depicted  the boat as a  place of perdition for  the youth of
Amsterdam, justifying its seizing.</p>

<p>If you  know Amsterdam you know  how ridiculous this is,  a trick that
could be played on a vast number of public places on a Saturday night,
nevertheless  the  cultural  and  political  significance  of  the  MS
Stubnitz seems  a defined target for the  prohibitionist powers taking
over our city. <a href="http://www.ailoveamsterdam.nl/geef-de-stad-terug-aan-de-amsterdammers/">Ai! Amsterdam</a>.</p>

      <p class="first">With <a href="http://derstandard.at/fs/1256744077182/Uni-Proteste-Tag-15-Wieder-Zehntausende-auf-der-Strasse">thousands  of students protesting  in Austria and Germany</a>,  it is
now clear  that the <a href="documents/anomalous_wave-eng-nov09.pdf">Anomalous Wave</a> advances  inexorably across Europe:
it  crosses languages  as well  political and  economical differences,
uniting a generation of young  people increasingly aware of the rights
they are being negated and the future they are being stolen.</p>

<p>The &quot;Unsere  Uni&quot; movement both  in <a href="http://unsereuni.at/">Austria</a> and <a href="http://unsereunis.de/">Germany</a>  is blossoming
with various initiatives, a grass-root participation in youth protests
that can be hardly found in <em>social-democratic-land</em> and dulcis in fundo
lots   arguments   and   reasons   for  being   hungry   against   the
commercialization   of   culture.     Here   below   the   <em>Allgemeiner
Forderungskatalog</em> from Austrian students:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><strong>Antidiskriminierung</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Wir fordern antidiskriminatorische Betriebsvereinbarungen und
Anti-Diskrimninierung als Grundkonsens in allen Bildungseinrichtungen.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Das so genannte Behindertengleichstellungsgesetz muss in allen
Institutionen des Bildungswesens umgesetzt werden. Wir fordern
barrierefreies Studieren, Lehren und Lernen. D.h. beispielsweise
die Verfügbarkeit von Dolmetscher_innen zur Übersetzung in
Gebärdensprache sowie infrastrukturelle Maßnahmen für Menschen mit
besonderen Bedürfnissen, Bsp. Barrierefreie Räume und Lifte;</li>
<li>Wir fordern eine 50-prozentige Frauenquote in allen
Arbeitsbereichen des Bildungswesens auf allen Ebenen;</li>
<li>Wir fordern Quoten zur Förderung von Migrant_innen in allen
Arbeitsbereichen des Bildungswesens auf allen Ebenen;</li>
<li>Wir fordern Maßnahmen gegen Diskriminierung von LGBTQ-Personen
(lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/transsexual, queer) und
weiteren Angehörigen systematisch diskriminierter Gruppen in allen
Arbeitsbereichen des Bildungswesens auf allen Ebenen;</li>
<li>Wir fordern gleiches Recht auf Mobilität und Bildung unabhängig von
Staatsbürger_innenschaft; Z.B.: Keine doppelten Studiengebühren von
Drittstaatsangehörigen sowie die Anerkennung von akademischen
Titeln aller Länder.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><strong>Demokratisierung der Universitäten</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Unser Ziel ist die demokratische Organisation der Universitäten. Dazu
gehört eine Demokratisierung der Verwaltung in einer Form, die
Professor_innen, Studierende, das wissenschaftliche und
nicht-wissenschaftliche Personal gleichberechtigt an der
Entscheidungsbildung beteiligt.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Wir fordern eine demokratische, selbstverwaltete Organisation der
Universitäten.</li>
<li>Wir fordern eine gleichberechtigte Einbeziehung aller vier Kurien:
Studierende, Mittelbau, Professor_innen und allgemeines
Universitätspersonal.</li>
<li>Wir sprechen uns gegen die Dominanz von Rektorat, Unirat und
Ministerium aus.</li>
<li>Wir bestehen auf der Zusammenlegung des Ministeriums für Unterricht
und Kunst und des Ministeriums fur Wissenschaft und Forschung.</li>
<li>Wir fordern die Abschaffung des Universitätsrates.</li>
<li>Wir fordern die Beschneidung der Befugnisse des Rektorats bei
gleichzeitiger Aufwertung demokratisch legitimierter Gremien.</li>
<li>Wir fordern die Abschaffung von quantifizierenden
Kontrollmechanismen wie Leistungsvereinbarungen und
Wissensbilanzen.</li>
<li>Wir fordern Budgettransparenz. D.h. die Offenlegung aller
Finanzaktivitäten und die demokratische Mitbestimmung bei der
Budgetverteilung.</li>
<li>Wir fordern die Rücknahme der ÖH-Wahlrechtsreform von 2004 und die
Wiedereinführung des direkten Wahlmodus.</li>
<li>Selbst-organisierte studentische Räume müssen geschützt und
unterstützt werden. Die derzeitigen Besetzungen zeigen die
Notwendigkeit des Austauschs und der Vernetzung in autonomen
Räumen.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><strong>Keine Ökonomisierung von Bildung</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Wir fordern den freien Hochschulzugang und die Abschaffung
ökonomischer Kriterien für den Zugang zu Bildung, welche den
strukturellen Rassismus und die soziale und ökonomische
Ungleichheit aufrecht erhalten, d.h. die Abschaffung aller
Studiengebühren und die Aufhebung aller weiteren finanziellen
Zugangsbarrieren im Bildungsbereich und zwar unabhängig von
Staatsbürger_innenschaft, Alter und Dauer des Studiums.</li>
<li>Schluss mit Unterfinanzierung, Wettbewerbslogik und Elitenbildung
im Bildungsbereich, d.h. keine Privatisierung und kein Ausverkauf
öffentlicher Einrichtung und Güter.</li>
<li>Die Qualität von Bildung und Lehre soll nicht durch
Zugangsbeschränkungen, sondern durch ausreichende Finanzierung im
Bildungssektor gewährleistet werden.</li>
<li>Wir fordern die Abschaffung prekärer Dienstverhältnisse im
Bildungsbereich sowie in der gesamten Arbeitswelt. D.h. keine
a-typischen Beschäftigungsverhältnisse wie freie Dienstverträge,
zeitlich befristete Verträge, Werkverträge etc. Die systematische
Prekarisierung von Lehrenden und Forschenden hat Vereinzelung,
Verunsicherung, Demotivierung und Konkurrenzdenken zur Folge.</li>
<li>Wir fordern die Ausfinanzierung aller Bildungseinrichtungen.</li>
<li>Wir fordern die Finanzierung von Forschung und Lehre in einem
Ausmaß, das die Beschaffung von Drittmittel nicht notwendig macht.</li>
<li>Wir reklamieren das Streikrecht für Student_innen und
Schüler_innen.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><strong>Selbstbestimmtes Studieren</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Abschaffung des Selektionsinstruments der Studieneingangsphasen
(STEPs) inklusive ihrer Knock-Out-Prüfungen.</li>
<li>Schluss mit den Voraussetzungsketten.</li>
<li>Freie Wahlfächer statt Erweiterungscurricula.</li>
<li>Abschaffung der intransparenten Anmeldesysteme.</li>
<li>Abschaffung der Deadlines für Sozialförderungen.</li>
<li>Die Beendigung des angefangenen Diplomstudiums muss gewährleistet
sein. Dazu bedarf es eines entsprechenden Lehrangebots und fixer
Äquivalenzlisten sowie der Aufhebung der bestehenden
Übergangsfristen.</li>
<li>Aufrechterhaltung aller bestehenden Diplomstudiengänge.</li>
<li>Gewährleistung der Anrechenbarkeit von Lehrveranstaltungen und
Abschlüssen im In- und Ausland.</li>
<li>Freie Zugänge zu allen Studiengängen.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Außerdem sprechen wir uns aus:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Gegen die Einführung der Zentralmatura.</li>
<li>Gegen ein autoritäres Beurteilungssystem in Schulen – Sitzenbleiben
abschaffen.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><strong>Geschichtliche Aufarbeitung</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Wir fordern die Erhaltung, die Förderung und den Ausbau kritischer
und emanzipatorischer Forschung und Lehre.</li>
<li>Wir verlangen die Restitution aller im Zuge der Shoa geraubten
Güter, die sich in „Besitz“ der Universitäten sowie anderer
staatlicher Einrichtungen befinden.</li>
<li>Wir bestehen auf der geschichtspolitischen Auseinandersetzung, mit
der Teilhabe der Wissenschaft und ihrer Institutionen, an
Kolonialismus, Faschismus und Nationalsozialismus.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Wir fordern freie Bildung für alle!</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nethemba.com/research">Researchers    at   Nethemba</a>    released   a    few   days    ago   an
<a href="http://www.nethemba.com/mfoc.tar.bz2">implementation  of the  nest  attack on  Mifare  Classic cards</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We have analysed Czech/Slovak  most used public transport and access
smart  cards  (Bratislava  public  transport  card,  University/ISIC
cards,  parking  cards, Slovak  Lines  cards  etc)  based on  Mifare
Classic technology.  Using various technologies and thanks to public
available academical papers, we have demonstrated the possibility of
gaining all  access keys used  for the card content  encryption.  We
have  also verified  that these  keys can  be subsequently  used for
complete reading,  altering and  cloning the cards  that can  pose a
serious threat for affected transport companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fairly well  packaged, this software progressively  discovers the keys
closing the blocks on the RFID cards, starting from at least one known
key  (commonly found,  as mentioned  by Roel  Verdult in  his &quot;Classic
Mistakes&quot; lecture) using the &quot;Nested Authentication Attack&quot; documented
by  the  paper  &quot;Wirelessly   Pickpocketing  a  Mifare  Classic  Card&quot;
published by scholars of the Radboud University in Nijmegen.</p>

<p>Theoretically this  is nothing  so new, nevertheless  this is  a fully
working implementation (and  fast, thanks to libNFC) that  can let you
crack Mifare  chips using  a 30$ cheap  touch-a-tag without  more tech
skills than compiling a small C  code. Tried on the dutch OV-chip card
today: it took less than 2 hours  to find all the keys of the card and
read out all its sectors. Wide open, quite impressive.</p>

<p>Nethemba's head of  research Pavol Lupták will soon  present in person
his findings at the upcoming <a href="http://200902.confidence.org.pl/prelegenci/pavol-luptak/">Confidence 2.0</a> in Warsaw.</p>

      <p class="first">Definitely  the most  interesting  Biennale of  contemporary art  I've
heard of  this year,  at least judging  from the artist's  line-up and
surrounding statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;The  artists  use all  the  detritus  of  a post-industrial  global
economy  which uses  Haiti as  a  dumping ground.   They return  the
compliment,  creating astounding  bricolages  and assemblages  which
express  both the despair  and the  seemingly endless  creativity of
Haiti and Vodou. I have  visited their ateliers on Haiti's Grand Rue
on several occasions  over the last four years. I  have had a chance
to  see their  sculptures  as  they were  being  wrought from  their
desperate materials  in a scrap yard  on this wreck of  a street, in
this wreck of a city, in  this wreck of a country.  Saying all that,
I would also have to add  that, like Haiti, their sculptures seem to
express  the   boundless  creative  energy  of  a   people  who  are
simultaneously  the economically  poorest, and  artistically richest
culture in the New World.&quot;  ( Professor Donald Cosentino, World Arts
and Cultures, University of California, LA )</p>

with their witty critical project called OINGO, about NGO abuse:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Our project  looks to the  ghetto biennale as a  counter exhibition,
disrupting  conventional art  scene exclusions,  as well  as  a bold
conversion of  global power systems, centers of  art production, and
cultural  transmission.  As  U.S.   artists proposing  to travel  to
Port-au-Prince, Haiti  to participate in  the Ghetto Biennale  it is
important to us  to be part of a  critical dialogue about globalism.
There are approximately 10,000  NGO's operating in Haiti, all backed
by the interests and finances of the US, France and Canada.  Many of
these NGOs  are immersed in agricultural  production.  The resulting
farms  are  part and  parcel  of  the  global industry  of  economic
assistance.  We  are interested in utilizing  tangerines and oranges
from  farms  that  have  become  part of  the  Haitian  agricultural
landscape through the presence of US funded NGO's.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among the  other things  found in the  documentation of  this Biennale
there is  this fascinating warning  for those submitting to  the call:
&quot;Artists should be  aware that Haiti has only a  50% literacy rate and
text heavy projects could be problematic for the local audience&quot;.</p>

        <h2>Rich countries cut food aid</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">The      Guardian       newspaper      yesterday      reported      an
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/oct/11/millions-starvation-food-aid-cuts">impressive  declaration  by the  head  of  UN's  World Food  Programme</a>
stating that in a near future  several millions of people will be lost
to  malnutrition,   riots  and  political   destabilisation,  as  rich
countries  have  minimized  aid  funding  for  food  rations  in  poor
countries.</p>

<p>As extreme as it sounds, this  projection could lead to a reality well
defined  by earlier  analysis as  that  of the  Club of  Rome and  MIT
researchers. From the article:</p>

<p>This could be the &quot;loss of a generation&quot; sayd Josette Sheeran, head of
the UN's WFP, feeding aid food to nearly 100 million people a year &quot;We
are facing a silent tsunami [...]  a humanitarian disaster&quot;.</p>

<p>Quoting some parts of the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The US, by  far the world's biggest contributor to  food aid, has so
far pledged $800m less than in 2008; Saudi Arabia has paid only $10m
in 2009  compared with  $500m in  2008; and the  EU has  given $130m
less.  Britain's promise of $69m this year is nearly $100m less than
2008, and, if nothing more is given, will be its lowest contribution
since 2001.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[..]</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">World food supplies are under increased strain this year following a
succession of  droughts, typhoons, floods and  earthquakes that have
destroyed crops in  Africa and south-east Asia. But  human needs are
also  greater because  the financial  crisis has  led  to widespread
unemployment.  In  addition, the remittances  from foreign nationals
living in  rich countries  to their families  at home are  20% lower
than last year.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Last month the UN said that the number of hungry people in the world
had increased by more than 150 million in a single year to more than
one billion. Aid agencies last  week warned of severe food shortages
in southern India after heavy floods damaged hundreds of millions of
dollars' worth of crops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">This  is the  worst food  crisis  since the  1970s. We  will lose  a
generation. Children will never recover,&quot; said Sheeran.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">More than 40 million people  could be affected by the WFP's enforced
scaling back  of its food rations.  Countries most likely  to be hit
include Bangladesh, where the budget is  likely to be cut by as much
as  50%, and Kenya,  where similar  cuts will  worsen the  plight of
millions of extra people made destitute by a long drought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;We are  making hard choices  over who to  feed.  We are  very aware
that  as we  dismantle  [feeding  programmes] it  may  take out  the
underpinning  of society  and leads  to  political destabilisation,&quot;
said Sheeran.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;We are  very concerned  about the large  budget shortfall  faced by
WFP,  which means  the  programme has  to  cut the  food rations  to
millions  of people  who  rely  on this  assistance  for their  very
survival,&quot; said Fred  Mousseau, Oxfam's humanitarian policy adviser.
&quot;This will translate  into more child deaths, with  more than 16,000
children already dying from hunger-related causes every day.&quot;</p>

<p>Also in  the Netherlands  is found a  valuable heritage  of squatters,

phenomenons  of  house market  speculations  and  letting artists  and
migrants develop outside of the constraints of the capitalist system.</p>

<p>Just these  days the  Dutch Parliament hosts  an hot  discussion about
abolishing  squatting,  which  is  currently &quot;protected&quot;  by  granting
squatters the right for a regular court-case about their occupation of

        <h2>Abbenay Hackerspace Stockholm</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">The  global  Hackerspace  movement  is  rapidly  bouncing  initiatives
between USA and Europe this year, last but not least this new squatted
space in Stockholm called  &quot;Abbenay&quot;, resisting to threats of eviction
and, what's  most important, making a  good point about  its reason to
exist. Here below a call of the hacker occupants which openly asks for
a  dialogue with  all players  involved,  including the  owner of  the
building:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The <a href="http://www.abbenay.org/">Abbenay  hacklab</a> opened early  <a href="http://lekernel.net/blog/?p=544">this month in Stockholm</a>,  where a
housing crisis is at full blow.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We are set up in a place that was squatted downtown by Kommando Carl
Bildt since late August, called AK4. The house was empty since June,
and there was no plans to use it until one year and a half.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Unfortunately,  squats   are  very   unusual  in  Sweden,   and  the
discussions  with  the  landlord  and  the  city  of  Stockholm  are
extremely  difficult, even though  many newspapers  speak positively
about AK4.  The place currently  sets a record for the country, with
a life  time of one month  (and counting) while  most squats usually
get raided by the police in a few days.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We  are  however  facing  an  imminent eviction  threat  and  police
pressure has been significantly  increasing lately - with civil cops
coming very often to take pictures of the house and sirens waking us
up early in the morning.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">This call is  asking you to contact the landlord  to show support to
the  hacklab  and  the  squat.  So  far, he  has  been  very  closed
minded. He only proposed that we leave the place and talked about an
expensive and abusive rental contract.   It was about a much smaller
office, and according  to which we would not be  allowed to sleep in
the premises,  we would  not be allowed  to host concerts,  cafes or
parties, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The landlord is  Fredrik Winberg; he is the <a href="http://www.masterclub.se/konsulter.html">CEO  of Cementa AB</a>, part
of HeidelbergCement  Global with a  revenue of 15 billion  euros per
year. He also runs the <a href="http://www.biteam.com/">Biteam AB company</a>.  We do not believe that he
or any  of his fellows will  turn poor should we  definitely get the
house  in Stockholm,  and we  think that  his behavior  is basically
motivated by  the capitalist idea  that the right to  stay somewhere
must always be paid for.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We hereby ask  you to contact him to expose  your views on squatting
and hackerspaces in  order to give him a  more comprehensive view on
the  subject   than  what  he   could  have  had  as   a  capitalist
entrepreneur. His contact email is fredrik.winberg at cementa.se and
he can be reached by phone at  +46 (0)708 25 68 04 (NB: this contact
information is available from the WWW).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We do  not give  a &quot;copy and  paste&quot; email  to send him,  since mail
bombing  would   probably  not   be  effective  and   only  increase
tensions. Also, please do not  be aggressive nor engage in any other
activity (defacing etc.) which would not lead anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

The Abbenay Hacklab</p>

found  key-phrases like  &quot;monitor security  down to  the neighbourhood
level&quot;  and &quot;intelligent  information  system supporting  observation,
searching   and  detection   for   security  of   citizens  in   urban
environment&quot;, titles  like &quot;IDetecT 4ALL&quot; or  &quot;SAMURAI&quot;, projects like
&quot;TALOS&quot; to develop unmanned patrol vehicles for border controls.</p>

<p>A  Kafkian  feeling  is  given  by reading  this  document,  while  it
represents a  succulent documentation to understand  the imaginary and
dialectic  of  European fears:  migration  and  terrorism are  closely
related, war threats can be  hidden everywhere, urban public space and
border  zones are  at high  risk, even  private spaces  are dangerous,
everything can be used against everyone.  I have no doubts this is the
scenario  of  a  collective  paranoid  mind, as  well  for  a  growing
generational conflict,  see the <a href="http://www.edri.org/edri-gram/number7.18/freedom-not-fear-2009">Freedom Not Fear</a>  protests against the
surveillance mania.</p>

<p>Last but not least, all countries involved are actually European, with
two  exceptions:  Turkey  and Israel,  over-militarised  Mediterranean
countries  definitely  not   complying  with  European  standards  for
human-rights, still  receiving more security funds.   Should we wonder
how such advanced technologies will be deployed there?</p>

<p>Better not.   I'd feel  much better not  knowing all this,  maybe this
should  be the next  step of  Europe to  keep the  mental peace  of it
citizens:   seamless   control  and   secreted   plans  for   security
research. This  is the  sad paradox for  a governance that  can either
despotically and silently hide  an explosion of fear or democratically
and transparently implode in paranoia.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tni.org/detail_pub.phtml?&amp;know_id=318">NeoConOpticon  -  The  EU  Security-Industrial Complex</a>  is  a  related
publication  by  Ben Hayes  (Statewatch  and TransNational  Institute)
dealing with the issues I'm mentioning here. The colophon recites:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Despite  the  often  benign  intent  behind  collaborative  European
&quot;research&quot;   into  integrated   land,  air,   maritime,   space  and
cyber-surveillance  systems, the  EU's  security and  R&amp;D policy  is
coalescing  around   a  high-tech  blueprint  for  a   new  kind  of
security. It envisages a future  world of red zones and green zones;
external borders  controlled by military  force and internally  by a
sprawling  network  of physical  and  virtual security  checkpoints;
public spaces,  micro-states and &quot;mega events&quot;  policed by high-tech
surveillance systems  and rapid reaction  forces; &quot;peacekeeping&quot; and
&quot;crisis  management&quot; missions that  make no  operational distinction
between the  suburbs of  Basra or the  Banlieue; and  the increasing
integration of  defence and national security functions  at home and
abroad.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">It is  not just a  case of &quot;sleepwalking  into&quot; or &quot;waking up  to&quot; a
&quot;surveillance  society&quot;, as  the Britain's  Information Commissioner
famously warned, it feels more like turning a blind eye to the start
of  a new  kind  of arms  race, one  in  which all  the weapons  are
pointing inwards. Welcome to the Neo-ConOpticon.</p>

worked, even with my 2nd hand phone which is more than 6 years old, it
was amazing to see such  backward compatibility and the huge potential
it has for developing countries.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://it46.se/entry/380">Alberto  puts it</a>, we've been waiting  over 20 years to  make such a
phone call :) while <a href="http://lists.dyne.org/lurker/message/20090918.191705.68409c34.en.html">Alejo is already setting something up in Colombia</a>,
the  <a href="http://openbts.sourceforge.net">OpenBTS</a> project  seems to  be the  main  reference implementation
running on USRP base stations.</p>

<p>This truly is a ground-breaking  development, despite the fact it took
too  long  to  come,  mostly   because  of  &quot;security&quot;  seals  on  GSM
communication protocols to endure the business of state monopolies.</p>

      <p class="first">&quot;Non  Governmental  Organisations&quot;  hit  the market  of  managing  the
balance of  carbon emissions  with a &quot;good  old colonialist  taste&quot; it
seems.</p>

<p>As  reported  by  <a href="http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48345">IPS  news</a>,  the  &quot;Forests  Absorbing  Carbon-dioxide
Emissions  Foundation&quot; (FACE),  a Dutch  organisation involved  in the
voluntary  carbon  market,  has  generated controversy  as  indigenous
people in the Mount Elgon region  have been displaced to clear the way
for tree-planting projects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Under carbon  trading programmes, companies  that release greenhouse
gases can either reduce their emissions  or buy the right to keep on
polluting, by paying for emissions-reducing projects somewhere else.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The United  Nations considers carbon markets an  efficient system to
guide  investments toward cutting  greenhouse emissions.   The Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) established by the Kyoto Protocol allows
two types of forestry  offsets: reforestation of previously forested
areas and  afforestation, that is, planting new  trees where forests
have not existed for over 50 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Carbon trading is divided  into two separate markets: the compliance
market  - as provided  for under  the CDM  and the  European Union's
Emission  Trading  Scheme,  mandatory  programmes worth  32  billion
dollars last  year -  and the much  smaller voluntary  carbon offset
market.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Voluntary  carbon offsets  involve individuals,  companies  and even
governments  to pay for  projects to  mitigate their  greenhouse gas
emissions. These projects range  from wind farms and other renewable
energy  sources,   to  efforts  to  reduce   methane  released  from
landfills, to forestry.</p>

      <p><a href="http://indymedia.nl/nl/2009/09/61595.shtml">Indymedia</a>  reports  violence and  police  repression against  hundreds
people in Prague, spontaneously willing to liberate an abandoned space
to put it in function for the community as a squatted social center.</p>

<p>Their declaration of intention follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">This house  has been  chosen for several  reasons: it's  empty since
many  years, neglected  and  left to  disrepair.  Even the  smallest
reparation works has not been done  and the roof is then broken with
water coming in.  On the other hand, door and  windows are very well
walled up, so that nobody can live in here.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">According to an auction report,  this house would be &quot;an ideal place
to  build luxury  appartements  and commercial  spaces&quot;, that  means
another  victory  of  profit  and  not  the one  of  real  needs  of
inhabitants of the city, who  can see emerging luxury houses, but no
affordable  housing,  like  if  the  need  for  it  would  not  even
exist.  This  particular house  is  constantly  secured against  all
those, who don't  have a place to stay, because  it's there to serve
to  the rich  and for  the commercial  purpose, which  is  a process
happening  in the  whole  center of  Prague.  And it  is becoming  a
display window, deprived of any  sign of everyday life of those, who
can't afford the expensive housing and who don't go shopping in posh
stores.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The building  of the former  bathhouse dating back  to 1932 is  in a
complicated situation: the estate  agents, who own the house, cannot
dispose of  it, because it's  probably in a bad  financial situation
and the house is now used  as a guarantee. The house went in auction
in 2002, but unsuccesfully. It could  then fall into much of a worse
state in the  next few years or it can become  a cultural and social
space,  different  from the  uniform  Prague  centre.  A place  that
wouldn't serve only to those, who would live in there, but to a wide
public, who miss something specific in the town centre...</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The SAM or Secure Access Module  is an additional feature in a Smart
Card Reader  that can  enhance the level  of security in  your Smart
Card based application.  Normally card authentication is implemented
in PC or application level.  However with the presence of a SAM, key
diversification and mutual authentication can be implemented between
card  and  reader which  means  that the  PC  will  not perform  the
authentication but it will be done  via card to reader and reader to
card authentication making your system more secure and less prone to
hacking.</p>

<p>We've used 15k EUR (plus a  5k EUR worth of facilities and hosting) to
support a team  of a dozen developers over a period  of 9 months. Most
of us  are living in Europe, so  this money was more  an incentive for
volunteering rather than an income,  but it served motivating the team
to achieve concrete results in an established time frame.</p>

others.</p>

<p>In  brief now  FreeJ became  <a href="http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/libfreej-dev">a library  with language  bindings</a>, fully
cross-platform,  providing applications  with a  low-latency streaming
engine that can  be scripted in javascript and  controlled from Python
or  Ruby. A  couple of  new  graphical interfaces  are being  actively
developed,  mostly to  demonstrate  the possibilities  offered by  the
engine, like the <a href="http://www.xant.net/freej.dmg">Carbon</a> version for OSX 10.5 and the script console in
PyGTK.   On  the  web  front  we  also  had  major  enhancements  like
integration with video RSS feeds (tested on <a href="http://www.giss.tv/dmmdb">DMMDB</a> and <a href="http://www.plumi.org">Plumi</a> CMS).</p>

<p>Lots  more can  be  done  from now  on:  broadcasting applications  of
various kinds, besides more debugging and adjustments on streaming: as
soon as Ogg/Vorbis/Theora playback is a stable implementation in HTML5
browsers we will  finally get rid of proprietary  technology in online
video streaming ;)</p>

<p>We will soon tag a 1.0  release, still conscious of known bugs we plan
to fix during the 1.x lifetime which should last one or two years. The
wide outreach given by OSX  and Debian packaging will help stabilizing
the engine and maybe gather some community funding.  Many TV companies
have contacted us so far about  collaborations, this is a good time to
make plans, we can adapt this new 1.0 framework to different needs.</p>

      <p class="first">The hacker  e-zine ZFO came  out with its  5th issue &quot;Summer  of Ham&quot;,
gaining lots  of popularity for the groundbreaking  publication of all
the &quot;personal digital life&quot; of  Kevin Mitnick and Dan Kaminsky, famous
showbiz hackers and security consultants,  hacked in a pretty lame way
in their very home.</p>

<p>The issue is really funny to  read, but you need to have some sysadmin
and  coding  knowledge  to  catch  the fun:  it  actually  realizes  a
wonderful  piece  of  literature  in  machine-language,  developing  a
narrative  exploring the  files of  the two  hacked-hackers  and their
techniques  to  keep  secure   their  websites,  and  those  of  their
customers.</p>

<p>Very nice to  see that someone is breaking  the ice of representation,
this is not an act of  terrorism rather than pure poetry declaring the
fact that <em>Security doesn't exists</em> and those selling it by the pound or
waving  it  at blinky  conferences  in  Las  Vegas are  just  decadent
puppets.</p>

<p>Here  below  an interesting  excerpt:</p>


<pre class="example">

       We don't make a peace bond

The security scene  is fucked. You have Dan  Kaminsky lecturing you on
how DNS poisoning  will destroy life as we know  it. You have Matasano
harvesting talent  and critiquing everyone,  and then Ptacek  can only
announce  the release  of....a graphical  firewall  management client.
There's kingcope  killing bugs and dropping  weaponized exploits while
making no  other contribution  except putting a  smile on the  face of
kiddies. There's  iDefense and their competitors  selling exploits and
only doing  research in how to  make more exploits.  There's Jeff Moss
running a  conference under the hideous  misnomer &quot;Blackhat Briefings&quot;
where the same researchers search  for glory and present the same shit
year after year. There are people who just live press release by press
release. And on top  of it all, somehow you STILL have  not got rid of
Kevin Mitnick.  The industry cares  about virtualization one  year and
iPhones the  next, every  year forgetting the  lessons it  should have
picked up in the last.

If you are just someone looking to  pay a fair price to not get owned,
you find  out quickly  that none  of these people  exist to  help you.
Very few people in this  industry have their income model based around
actually making you  more secure. At best, some of  them have it based
around convincing you that you are better off.

The  very concept  of &quot;penetration  testing&quot; is  fundamentally flawed.
The problem with  it is that the penetration tester  has a limited set
of targets they're allowed to attack, while a real attacker can attack
anything in order to  gain access to the site/box.  So if  a site on a
shared host is  being tested, just because site1.com  is &quot;secure&quot; that
does NOT in  anyway mean that the server  is secure, because site2.com
could easily be  vulnerable to all sorts of  simple attacks.  The time
constraint is another problem. A professional pentester with a week or
two to spend on a client's network may or may not get into everything.
A real  dedicated hacker making the  slog who spends a  month of eight
hour days WILL get into anything  they target. You're lucky if it even
takes him that long, really.

Those things should all be  very obvious, but whitehats still make the
mistake of discounting them. Look at Mitnick. Every time he gets owned
he blames his host or his  DNS provider. If he's getting owned through
them, that's still his fault.  Choosing a host is a security decision,
it's  just like  choosing a  password. If  you choose  a weak  one you
expose yourself.  It's still your fault.

It's   the   same   with   outsourcing   the   development   of   your
security-critical code.  Mitnick could get  someone else to make him a
flashy website,  and then blame them  when it is full  of file include
vulnerabilities.  People do this  all the  time, indirectly,  by using
ridiculous  CMS  or  blog  software.  As  an  easy  example,  look  at
Wordpress.  Even easier,  look  at Wordpress  in  2007.  Horrid.  When
considering Wordpress, a blackhat starts reading the PHP, shudders and
giggles, and then laughs at the idea  of ever using it on one of their
servers. A whitehat never gets  that far apparently, they just install
it  and  get  owned.  I  simply  fail  to  see  how  leading  security
researchers run  all kinds  of code that  is blatantly  dangerous. Are
they really that bad at reading code? Or do they just not care much if
their passwords end up on  Full Disclosure? If it's the second option,
why is that?  Why can these people make a living selling security when
they make such bad choices? How do they maintain legitimacy? They take
less responsibility for getting owned than do the people who they sell
services to.

There's a popular term for people who don't read code.
We call them script kiddies.

You cannot outsource  blame. You HAVE to take  responsibility for your
mistakes, whether they are mistakes in your code, mistakes in code you
are using, mistakes by your host,  or mistakes in who you trust. These
are all  security choices.  Learn to control  this shit. Learn  how to
read code.  A lot of the  time it only  takes a very shallow  audit to
realise that the code is crap and  is bound to have bugs. In a smarter
world,  security professionals get  paid to  stop people  from getting
owned. End of. These is no limit to the scope of an audit.

Are you professional  types really this out of touch?  I see all these
papers about how to protect yourself from these super-fucking-advanced
techniques and exploits that very few people can actually develop, and
most hackers will NEVER USE. It's the simple stuff that works now, and
will continue to work years into the future. Not only is it way easier
to dev for  simple mistakes, but they are easier to  find and are more
plentiful.

The  whole concept  of full-disclosure  has backfired.  It  will never
work. It's some slashdot hippie pipe dream. Even you dumbass corporate
types should recognize this. If  you're constantly giving away all the
vulnerabilites you  find, for *FREE*  mind you (and what  other industry
does that?), and the vulnerabilites  get harder and harder to find and
exploit, it will  get harder and harder for you all  to do your &quot;job&quot;.
Frankly, I'm  surprised that the non-disclosure  movement didn't start
in  the security industry  in the  first place.  In a  way it  did, by
default.   With full-disclosure,  the security  industry is  all about
show and  gloat, it is not about  fixing anything. A lot  of bugs have
been fixed  from it, but it comes  with the price of  an industry that
likes to cripple itself. Projects  run by teams of trained monkeys are
always eager to add more bugs to replace those that have been fixed.

We hate  the industry because  it is full  of shit. There are  so many
trolls like Kaminsky who just  desperately search for anything new, to
get  attention.   So  many  talentless  buffoons trying  to  scam  the
planet.  A   lot  of   the  actual  talent   out  there   is  severely
misapplied. It's  an industry  tied to news  and not  results, because
very few  of you can  even attain results.  When you can't,  who's the
wiser? Your  customers can  hardly tell if  you have really  made them
more  secure  or  not.   Sometimes  there  are  superficial  benefits,
sometimes there aren't. How do you convince the customer that they are
more ZF0-safe than  before, if they were never  targetted and probably
never will  be? And you all lack  the legitimacy to really  do the job
you should anyways. We can only expose so many frauds, the rest of you
can pretend you have changed something.

Very few whitehats  actually go out there and  provide a service where
they make people more  secure. Not just for a day or  a month. Are you
genuinely fixing  the underlying design and logic  flaws that generate
security problems for your clients or customers? If you actually clean
up every exposed security flaw  they have, will they still be &quot;secure&quot;
in six months or a year?

We could go on. Just in general, the industry is failing.
Flat out failing.
You cannot even protect yourselves.

        <h2>Drug decriminalization in Portugal</h2>
      </div>

    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">An  interesting  book titled  &quot;<a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10080">Drug  Decriminalization  in Portugal</a>  -
Lessons for Creating Fair  and Successful Drug Policies&quot; was published
recently this year, written by Glenn Greenwald.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">On  July 1,  2001, a  nationwide law  in Portugal  took  effect that
decriminalized all  drugs, including  cocaine and heroin.  Under the
new   legal  framework,   all  drugs   were   &quot;decriminalized,&quot;  not
&quot;legalized.&quot;  Thus, drug possession  for personal use and drug usage
itself  are  still  legally  prohibited,  but  violations  of  those
prohibitions are deemed  to be exclusively administrative violations
and are removed completely from the criminal realm. Drug trafficking
continues to be prosecuted as a criminal offense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The  objective of the  book is  to provide  an account,  complete with
empirical   metrics,   about   the   changes   occurred   after   drug
decriminalization in Portuguese society.  The conclusions are quite an
impressive lesson for future drug policies in Europe:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">More  significantly,  none  of  the nightmare  scenarios  touted  by
pre-enactment decriminalization  opponents - from  rampant increases
in drug usage among the young to the transformation of Lisbon into a
haven for &quot;drug tourists&quot; - has occurred.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The   political   consensus  in   favor   of  decriminalization   is
unsurprising in  light of the  relevant empirical data.   Those data
indicate that  decriminalization has had  no adverse effect  on drug
usage  rates in  Portugal, which,  in numerous  categories,  are now
among the lowest  in the EU, particularly when  compared with states
with      stringent      criminalization     regimes.       Although
postdecriminalization usage rates have  remained roughly the same or
even  decreased  slightly  when   compared  with  other  EU  states,
drug-related pathologies - such as sexually transmitted diseases and
deaths due to drug usage  - have decreased dramatically. Drug policy
experts attribute  those positive trends to the  enhanced ability of
the  Portuguese  government  to  offer  treatment  programs  to  its
citizens  - enhancements  made  possible, for  numerous reasons,  by
decriminalization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">On June 16th 2009, a  wired fence was built around Roma settlements,
while security  and police “guard” it on  external side. Recently,
wire was covered  by promotional banners of Universiade  in order to
hide  Roma people behind  it.  In  addition, police  patrol operates
along the wire fence inside this settlement! Residents are forbidden
to  leave the  settlement, to  walk  the streets  near Belville,  to
gather  materials from  surrounding dumpsters  (which is  their only
source of  income). These  measures have limited  the right  to free
movement  and  the  right  to   work  for  residents  of  this  Roma
settlement.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Belgrade authorities  have ignored the  problems of Roma  people for
more than decade  including refusal to provide them  with basic life
conditions. Now they went  step further in discriminating our fellow
citizens,  using  the  security   measures  for  Universiade  as  an
excuse. By  building the wired fence around  settlement and imposing
police surveillance - city authorities have shown that they actually
don't want  to deal  with improving life  conditions of  people, but
just  improve media  image of  this city.   The main  goal  of these
measures is  to hide  the &quot;shame&quot; -  poverty and misery  Roma people
live in, from international guests and public.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We will not let humiliation  of our fellow citizens, nor forging the
reality. The true image of Serbia consists of images of Belville and
Roma settlements next to each other, the corruption on highest level
and  fired  workers, privatization  of  University and  Universiade,
sports event that  turned out to be more  important than human lives
and dignity.  We  demand that wired fence around  Roma Settlement in
Block  67 is removed  IMMEDIATELY, as  well as  to start  working on
finding appropriate ways to improve life conditions of the residents
of the most vulnerable settlements in the city.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">No to ghettos in our neighborhood  for the &quot;benefit of city&quot;!  No to
Universiade  against human  dignity!  No  to authorities  that value
capital over  life of people and  use racist strategies as  a way of
management!</p>

and help  realization of  cultural programs, art  workshops, cooking
actions, movie projects.</p>

        <h2>Satellite navigation threatens local knowledge</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">BBC  published   today  an   interesting  article  about   fears  that
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8133890.stm">Sat-nav  systems are starting  to erode  local knowledge</a>.   It doesn't
really sound  like primitiveness, rather  than a worrying  argument on
how people  driving on sat-nav  ignore their surroundings and  loose a
certain  sense  of awareness  and  decision  making while  navigating.
Apparently this is not yet the case, as most frequent travelers aren't
relying much on their navigation device. Joe Moran writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We still don't  quite trust the electronic voice to  get us where we
want to  go. Since before even  the arrival of the  car, people have
worried  that maps  sever  us  from real  places,  render the  world
untouchable,  reduce it  to a  bare outline  of Cartesian  lines and
intersections.  Sat-nav  feeds into  this  long-held  fear that  the
cold-blooded modern world is  destroying local knowledge, that roads
no longer lead to real places but around and through them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Local  knowledge is  an extremely  important feature  for any  kind of
self-motivated operation around a certain neighbourhood, especially if
planned outside  the given  schemes of an  architecture; but  it seems
that sat-nav  users are acquainted at loosing  information (and power)
over their surroundings, a new  sort of <em>alienation</em>.  Still we must say
that maps  of terrains at high  detail, similar to  those now employed
for bicycle navigation,  were once harder to find,  mostly provided as
military grade information.</p>

<p class="quoted">In this  query driven society,  The Society of the  Query conference

semantic  web  lurking around  the  corner  revives  the &quot;human  vs.

critically  question the  distribution of  power, the  diversity and
accessibility of  web content, while promising  alternatives for the
dominant   paradigm  surface   in  peer-to-peer   and   open  source

        <h2>Hackerspace festival account</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">Back from  <a href="http://www.tmplab.org">tmp/lab</a> in Paris, here is  a short account of  just some of
the interesting things  found among the talks. The  whole festival was
amazing -  I'd even say legendary  - and surely won't  be forgotten by
its  participants. It  challenged everyone  in the  making,  since the
place that hosted  it was in a really bad  condition, it required some
practical skills and good cooperation by all people present.</p>

<p>Food was really good.  It was delicious and nutrient.  Kudos to JNM of
<a href="http://craslab.org">craslab.org</a>  and all  the volunteers  who  helped.  Big  kudos to  the
farmers who brought  us a 400EUR worth of  biological food (old-school
farming,  very  tasty  and  healthy)  that fueled  the  whole  5  days
festival.   Look up  the french  <a href="http://www.reseau-amap.org/">AMAP</a>  networks, they  are an  awesome
alternative to the food industry  crisis.  There are times when even a
5 star catering can make you hug a toilet after two days of conference
food; considered  the conditions  and the tools,  this was  some magic
&quot;heros feast&quot; spell  casted twice per day, with  vegetarian dishes for
everyone, still filling up the diet very well.</p>

<p>Now  let's go  through the  content of  HSF: I'm  gathering  here some
interesting links  to things presented,  still sorry that  this humble
account won't cover all the interventions deserving it.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hackerspace.net/gaming-platform-libre">Gaming Platform  Libre</a> was a delight for those of  us who dream of
game  development on free  platform and  I must  admit I  wasn't aware
myself of the  many things being said, even  if usually researching on
the  topic.   The <a href="http://yasep.org">YASEP</a>  platform  was  presented  (Yet Another  Small
Embedded Processor) and its instruction set explained, all accompanied
by <a href="http://f-cpu.seul.org/whygee/HSF/HSF2009_GPL.html">these slides presented by Laura Bécognée and Yann Guidon</a>.</p>

<p>A well  known cryptographer, Karsten  Nohl, has illustrated  in detail
the procedure  of reverse engineering integrated circuits  as RFID: it
was  quite  an  experience  to  hear  such a  talk  by  the  one  that
reverse-engineered  the  MiFare  -  CRYPTO1  :)</p>

<p>Among the  tools Karsten  mentioned a software  I didn't  knew before:
<a href="http://degate.zfch.de/">Degate</a>  helps you  explore ICs,  matching logic  gates on  the imagery
given  by graphical  templates and  assisting you  in  tracing circuit
paths.</p>

<p>More on  the blinky side  of life was  the presentation of  <a href="http://blog.knokorpo.fr">Kiniou</a> who
demonstrated  how  to import  Open  Office  presentations in  Blender,
taking  advantage of  a  3d environment  to  show your  slides. He  is
publishing this and other stuff on the website <a href="http://dev.knokorpo.fr">knokorpo.fr</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.hackerspace.lu/wiki/Syn2cat">Syn2Cat</a> hackerspace crew from Luxembourg was present all the time,
animating  a blinkful space  in the  HSF as  well giving  an inspiring
presentation  of their  activities,  well oriented  to animate  public
spaces,  art  environments and  to  leverage  the political  discourse
around  civil   liberties.   Among  their  code  pearls   there  is  a
<a href="https://www.hackerspace.lu/wiki/Lasertag_linux">port of  LaserTag software on  GNU/Linux</a> (finally!!)  and  their early
<a href="https://www.hackerspace.lu/wiki/Clutter_Experiments">experiments with Clutter</a>.</p>


<p>At the  core of  the theoretical  discussion in HSF  there was  a very
interesting presentation  of <a href="http://www.egpl.info/">EGPL</a>, a general public  license that lets
authors &quot;exclude&quot;  certain uses for  their creations. Under  the motto
&quot;<strong>Creative  Uncommons License</strong>&quot;  (acronym  CUL) and  the  symbol (*)  it
unfolded  extremely  interesting insights  on  licensing, ethics,  the
pitfalls of Creative Commons license  and in general a deep reflection
on  the use  values of  creations. I've  actively participated  to the
debate trying  to defend  the total freedom  granted by  classical GNU
licenses,  still   I  must  admit  that  the   EGPL  arguments  aren't
superficial as it might seem on  the first glance and, until a certain
degree, they might even be implementable.</p>

<p>From the  Swedish hackerspace  <a href="http://forskningsavd.se">Forskningsavd</a> a young  phreaking genius
named      Kugg     came      to      present     his      experiments
<a href="http://forskningsavd.se/PublicWiki/w/Arduino_phone">interfacing Arduino boards to phone networks</a>: developing the so called
Optoshield  and,  *dulcis in  fundo*,  releasing  his  new creation  the
<strong>Arduino  Phoneshield</strong> -  all HSF  participants got  the  opportunity to
download the circuit  scheme of this new shield,  soon to be available
on  the webshop  of <a href="http://www.blushingboy.org">blushing  boy</a>.  Feels  like back  to the  roots :)
<a href="http://phretech.net">the phreaking scene will never die</a>.</p>

<p>During the  whole festival, the indefatigable  tmp/lab hacker <a href="http://www.hackerspace.net/sebastien-bourdeauducq">lekernel</a>
ran  several  workshops:  <a href="http://www.hackerspace.net/fabrication-de-biodiesel">how  to make  bio-diesel</a>  (in  collaboration
Gaëtan),  <a href="http://www.hackerspace.net/milkymist">Milkymist</a>  (an  hardware   Vj  platform  built  with  FPGA),
<a href="http://www.hackerspace.net/vacuum-tubes-your-grandpa-s-electronics">DIY Vacuum tubes  amplifier</a> and at last an  half day hands-on workshop
on <a href="http://www.hackerspace.net/fpga-verilog-for-beginners">FPGA Verilog</a> development. The guy is a mental Volcano eruption.</p>

<p>Another   good  interdisciplinary   presence  in   the   festival  was
<a href="http://www.rvba.fr">Milovann Yanatchkov</a>: this visionary  architect uses only free software
for  his work,  with  good  and original  results.   His workshop  was
entitled after Paul Graham's book  &quot;Hackers and Painters&quot; and ended up
illustrating the early concept of  perspective in Paolo Ucello as well
his experiments with <a href="http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/">Fluxus</a> 3D live coding engine..</p>

<p><em>Dulcis in fundo</em> there  were several interesting lightning talks, among
them the nomadic hacker  <a href="http://benn.org">Meinhard</a> gave <a href="http://sandbox.benn.org/sli/hsf2009/">three interesting presentations</a>
also pointing out this interesting <a href="http://www.anonet.org">anonet.org</a> initiative, which sounds
new to me. As well  <a href="http://gareus.org">Robin Gareus</a> outlining his new development project
at  the University of  Paris: <a href="http://theartcollider.org">theartcollider</a>,  something that  will be
very  interesting   for  all  of  us   experimenting  with  Ogg/Theora
streaming.</p>


<p>Feeling sorry  to have missed it  all? well you should  since this HSF
was really  legendary, until  the next  comes up: <strong>see  you in  2010 in
Istanbul</strong>!</p>

        <h2>Deforestation doesn't make people rich</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">A recent academic study on economical growth in deforested areas shows
that the <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2244106/deforestation-leads-boom-bust">benefits of this business are short-lived</a> and unsustainable.
&quot;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/324/5933/1435">Boom-and-Bust Development Patterns Across the Amazon Deforestation Frontier</a>&quot;
is  the title of  this research  that was  undertaken by  academics in
Cambridge, Montpellier and Lisbon.</p>

<p>The  idea that  forests are  worth more  alive than  dead  is commonly
advocated by natives, but for  decades we assisted to their massacres,
last  but not  least the  <a href="http://www.rootforce.org/2009/06/05/peruvian-police-murder-indigenous-protesters-take-action/">recent slaughter  in Peru</a>.  Apparently those
corporations making a business  on deforestation are too short sighted
and maybe even a bit sadistic, let me add.</p>

<p>Another study titled &quot;<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/economics/index_en.htm">The economics of ecosystems and biodiversity</a>&quot; is
running through its  first phase in Europe, as if  there would be more
evidence     needed      after     disasters     like      that     in
<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE4D81F3FF932A35752C1A9639C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all">the deforestation of Malawi</a>,  <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org/english/indonesia/forests.htm">Indonesia</a>, the well known Amazonian rain
forest and many others.</p>

<p>I'm feeling kind of stupid  in reporting all this. What really matters
is the  amount of  time that  the World needed  so far  to acknowledge
these  results: that  time  is directly  proportional  to the  urgency
motivating  the actions  of networks  like  E.L.F.  -  so wouldn't  be
better to  seek common ground and  start a peace  process, rather than
persecuting  the  so   called  &quot;eco-terrorists&quot;  and  keeping  current
policies?</p>

      <p class="first">Today I was having a look in an appealing technology for text analysis
so far neglected  in my research, mostly because of  lack of time: the
so called &quot;word cloud&quot;.</p>

<p>Rendering  a word  cloud implies  a fairly  complicated  algorithm for
&quot;packing&quot;, which  in recent  implementations explores the  presence of
vertical words and different colors.</p>

<p>For  a  while  the  state-of-the-art implementation  has  been  closed
source, implemented by  <a href="http://www.wordle.net">Wordle</a> as an online service  running in a java
applet. But a  refreshing announcement comes at hand  here, offering a
code   that    can   be    evaluated   in   Ruby    language,   thanks

      <p class="first">An  interesting signal  from London  where the  corruption  of several
Members of Parliament (mostly caused by alienating and disproportional
cast  privileges) is  causing the  resignation of  a minister  and the
expulsion of two members, while two Lords are investigated.</p>

<p>It       seems       to        have       started       with       the
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/">Daily Telegraph publishing  MP's expenses</a>, an investigative journalism
operation that costed 150k GBP to the tabloid. My heartfelt thanks for
the investment.</p>

<p>Interesting how media in UK is free to document all this and even play
a  role in  promoting the  investigations: quite  a different  code of
deontology in respect to what turned Italy in a media dictatorship.</p>

<p>In  the &quot;<em>Mani Pulite</em>&quot;  Italian episode  in the  early 90's  media also
played an  important role  <em>until they could</em>,  while the  operation was
mostly lead by  magistrates; they soon had to  leave their jobs, while
some became politicians like Di Pietro. Craxi for example had to leave
for  his  villa  in  Hammamet  (Libia),  while  the  highest  cast  of
politicians  still  welcomes  his   dynasty  today:  Craxi's  son  and
daughter.  In  fact nothing really  changed until today: the  wages of
Italian members of Parliament are  the higher in all Europe, double as
those of UK members.</p>

<p>I wonder  if British MP's  also have a  &quot;plan B&quot; ready in  an offshore
villa...</p>

<p>Here below a short transcript:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;Open Source&quot; doesn't mean free  access, nor open space or open air;
it  presumes a  <a href="http://www.themobilecity.nl/2008/01/05/designing-for-locative-media-seamless-or-seamful-experiences/">seamful</a>  approach to  design  as a  response to  the
increasing  reliance  on technology  and  its  accessibility; it  is
interactive    without    prescribed    boundaries,   following    a
combinatorial,  generative approach  to development;  it is  peer to
peer as no producer can  control further interaction patterns; it is
grassroot as creations are born out of initiative and cohesion based
on needs felt and understood in first person by community members.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">About  Creative Commons,  its  motto &quot;Some  rights  reserved.&quot; is  a
relatively  hollow  call: the  slogan  factually  reverses the  Free
Software and  Open Source philosophy  of reserving rights  to users,
not  copyright  owners, in  order  to  allow  the former  to  become
producers themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The  dis/appropriating loop of  creativity must  be recursive  to be
fruitful: not only production means belong to the people using them,
further creations should  be free to be recombined.   rights must be
granted focusing on people interacting, not just those providing the
interactive infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Unfortunately there is a diffuse lack of perception for alternatives
offered by the  Open Source and Free Software  approach over current
profit models.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">As a present  problem, also deriving from the  lack of understanding
of  the  importance  of  grass-root  creativity,  top-down  cultural
management is  patronising art production:  mass-media aesthetics of
an  entirely sanitised and  efficient creativity,  of the  sort that
will  not rely  on unstable  people  and can  therefore be  globally
rationalised.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">That the great artists of  modern Western culture managed to produce
what they did, despite the danger and intensity of their effort, was
due in large part to improvised social forms built around close-knit
networks where thought and affect circulated with high velocity, and
where it  was possible  to try out  forms of  non-conventional human
relationships that would not destroy, nor be destroyed by, a life of
art.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Seen  from an  historical perspective,  In  the second  half of  the
twentieth century  many of the  functions of creative  networks were
already  taken over  in Europe  by institutions  (government funding
bodies,  universities, museums,  etc)  and much  of their  excessive
feeling was  neutralised.  This was only  a small part  of a general
process  of   the  time:  the  absorption  of   human  emotion  into
bureaucratic channels,  and the emergence  of a social  coolness, an
efficiency of feeling.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">At this stage  in the twenty-first century, we are  in the middle of
another  large-scale  restructuring   of  ideas  of  creativity  and
culture.  As  one of  the most significant  generators of  image and
value, creativity now has become  a critical resource for the global
economic engine. What creativity is,  and how it can be systematised
and  circulated,  are  therefore  urgent questions  of  contemporary
capitalist organisation.  As cultural  producers are thrust into the
full intensity  of globally dispersed,  just-in-time production, new
images  of creative  inspiration and  output are  required  that sit
tidily within the systematised processes of the global market.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Creativity   must  be   rendered  comprehensible,   transparent  and
rational: there can  be none of the destructive  excesses evident in
the  lives of  many of  the  greatest artists  of European  history.
Creativity must  circulate cleanly and quickly, and  it should leave
no dirty remainder.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">For  what interests  Hollywood, and  the market  in general,  is not
creativity as  a complex human  process, weighed down in  bodies and
relationships and empty days, but creativity as an abstraction, free
of irrationality  and pain, and light  enough to hover  like a great
logo above the continents.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Perhaps,  as  the  logic  of systematised  production  occupies  the
terrain of human  creativity more completely, we will  reach a stage
where we surrender all knowledge about this troubling domain, and it
will  become entirely  alien  to us.   Perhaps  one day  we will  be
terrified  of  what  explosive   dangers  might  rise  up  from  the

      <p class="first">Today  is May Day  and anniversary  of the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taksim_Square_massacre">Taksim Square  massacre</a> in
1977,  when  extreme  right  wing  snipers  opened  fire  on  May  Day
demonstrators in Istanbul, killing 34 people.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago the Turkish parliament passed a law making May 1 a
national  holiday again.  It was  taken  off the  public holiday  list
following a military  coup in 1980.</p>

<p>Still,  there is  very  little coverage  on  the media  about what  is
happening  in Istanbul  today: an  unnatural silence,  while  even the
<a href="http://istanbul.indymedia.org">Istanbul   Indymedia   website</a>    is   defaced   by   some   religious
fundamentalists.</p>

<p>This                           recent                          article
<a href="http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/buglalilar270409.html">Deepening Crisis,  Growing Resistance: Workers in Turkey</a>  gives a good
overview on the  situation, while the following press  agency is all I
could find so far about the current riots:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">ISTANBUL (AFP)&mdash;Several  hundred May Day  demonstrators clashed with
police in central Istanbul Friday  in battles which saw water cannon
fired and  several arrests made.   Turkish riot police  staged three
charges against  hundreds of demonstrators in the  Sisli district of
the  city who  had hurled  rocks  at security  forces, according  to
correspondents at  the scene.  Several thousand union  and left wing
activists took part in the annual protest.</p>

      <p class="first">Geocities was the first place on the Internet where anyone could get a
free  website, hosting  several thousands  of websites  made available
before  the third millennium  (mostly all  decorated with  that cheesy
look that some of us nostalgically smile at).</p>

<p>Later  bought by  Yahoo,  the  company is  now  dropping the  service,
letting a huge piece of Internet's history fall away as a trail of its
financial  crisis.</p>

<p>While the <a href="http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/1961">Archive Team is busy saving Internet pre-history</a>, let me add
that <strong>Geocities is the first  world-wide implementation of what we call
&quot;social networks&quot;  and web-2.0 nowadays</strong>:  even if the interface  was a
simple FTP upload of HTML  pages, the social dynamic configured itself
as a (very chaotic) social web of people going public on the net.</p>

<p>Still I'll  honestly conclude that  Geocities hosted some of  the most
horribly designed pages that ever appeared on the Internet, but that's
a part of history we can learn from, right?</p>

too busy persecuting kids writing  viruses, they are not even aware of
the risks involved in building centralised information architectures.</p>

<p>Here
<a href="http://perens.com/works/articles/MorganHill/">Bruce Perens took his time to describe and warn about the situation in Morgan Hill</a>
when a few weeks ago unidentified attackers climbed down four manholes
and cut eight fiber cables serving the city.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">That attack demonstrated a  severe fault in American infrastructure:
its  centralization. The  city of  Morgan  Hill and  parts of  three
counties lost 911 service, cellular mobile telephone communications,
land-line  telephone,  DSL internet  and  private networks,  central
station fire  and burglar alarms,  ATMs, credit card  terminals, and
monitoring of critical utilities. In addition, resources that should
not  have  failed,  like  the  local  hospital's  internal  computer
network, proved  to be dependent on external  resources, leaving the
hospital with a &quot;paper system&quot; for the day.</p>

<p>Scary stuff,  especially considering the military  intelligence is too
busy developing futuristic warplanes and worrying about who stole them
the plans for their new super-secret toys.</p>

directions for the <a href="http://eipcp.net/n/1234779255?lid=1234779848">Post-Futurist</a> movements to come.</p>

<p>Among all the points made, the numbers 9 and 10 read good:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We want to ridicule the idiots  who spread the discourse of war: the
fanatics of competition, the fanatics of the bearded gods who incite
massacres,  the  fanatics  terrorised  by the  disarming  femininity
blossoming in all of us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We demand  that art  turns into a  life-changing force.  We  seek to
abolish  the separation  between poetry  and mass  communication, to
reclaim the power  of media from the merchants and  return it to the
poets and the sages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just  a doubt  about who  are the  sages,  this might  be a  bit of  a
controversy, along with other parts  of the text which sound like from
the middle-ages. I sense a lack  of peer to peer attitude overall, but
well it's  already a very good  step forward from  silence; I've never
been 100% happy with &quot;post-&quot; movements anyway.</p>

    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">Today is the 6th  of april, a date marking the birth  of a movement in
Cairo which  mostly coordinates and  grow online, with a  fixed yearly
appointment  on the  streets,  see  the blogs  in  <a href="http://6aprilmove.blogspot.com/">English</a> and  <a href="http://7arkt6april.blogspot.com/">Arabic</a>
languages; and since i really can't keep it inside, let me add more.</p>

<p>We're  living in a  peculiar period,  just before  the &quot;Epiphany  of a
Catastrophe&quot;:  it  is a  period  in  which  those who  foresee  what's
happening can be persecuted, lynched, imprisoned, exiled.</p>

<p>An metaphor  is offered  by the earthquake  which stroke  Abruzzo last
night,  for  which a  polemic  now  started:  the geologist  Giampaolo
Giuliani who predicted the disaster was called to court for &quot;<em>procurato
allarme</em>&quot;, calling a  crime his act of giving an  alarm that could have
saved the lives of many.</p>

<p>Im not sure what do you think about the last tumults in London City, i
guess you have heard, a man was killed by police it seems, for sure he
was  the  last  person  that  they wanted  to  beat  down...   factory
occupations started in Paris (deja vu?!)  <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/industrials/article5974895.ece">with kidnapping of managers</a>,
also  in London  a  factory was  occupied  by its  workers, the  story
unfolds on <a href="http://london.indymedia.org">London Indymedia</a> webpages. Way better initiatives for fired
workers, compared to those in USA (one dumped by IBM?! what a hot geek
gossip)  who opened  fire in  NYC killing  13 immigrants,  and another
fired-gunman the day after. I mean just yesterday. Quite some shocking
news, excuse me the tone.</p>

<p>As  time is accelerating,  we are  also.  Online  is possible  to keep
yourself  updated,  its getting  more  participative  thanks to  fluid
exchanges of  ideas and  views.  You can  even be persecuted  for your
public opinion - expressed by a simple click - just joining a group on
facebook.</p>

<p>I was visiting Cairo exactly one year ago, on 6 of april, when factory
workers  in the  nearby &quot;industrial  town&quot; of  Mahalla went  to engage
police in the street with sword  fights. have you heard of that? There
are times when, for as much as  we have heard and seen in the past few
years and predictably going to  see more, military intelligence had to
strike the  situation to  an end.  I  just wonder  how it is  going to
happen  today, when  the most  powerful intelligence  is media.</p>

<p>And  most importantly,  how long  it all  has to  occur before  we can
really  represent  the  state of  things?  is  it  the Epiphany  of  a
Catastrophe?</p>

documenting and coordinating his activity into this blog, hopefully it
served the purpose of introducing  pupils to GNU/Linux.</p>

<p><a href="http://dynebolic.org">Our  dyne:bolic live/CD</a>  works  quite straightforward  for the  simple
tasks it  has to accomplish; the  dyne:II core hasn't  been updated in
the past  2 years, we  could even argue  that's a feature :)  still we
support old  computers, provide a simple and  consistent interface for
GNU users and the simplest procedure installation ever :)</p>

<p>Later on  this year there  will be some  news about the future  of our
dyne operating  system ;) meanwhile keep  an eye on  <a href="http://puredyne.goto10.org">pure:dyne</a> and its
active  development crew,  rowing high  to  the goal  of a  multimedia
production system with higher hardware requirements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/opengazer/">Opengazer</a> is an open source application that uses an ordinary webcam
to estimate the direction of your gaze. This information can then be
passed to other applications.  For example, used in conjunction with
Dasher, opengazer allows you to write with your eyes. Opengazer aims
to be  a low-cost software alternative  to commercial hardware-based
eye trackers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which actually  works! after compiling the source  it runned smoothly,
tracking the  movements of my pupils  and moving the  mouse across the
screen... very cool sensation.</p>

      <p class="first">Today  US  Dept.   of  Defense  announced  the  creation  of  its  own
open-source code repository: <a href="http://forge.mil">Forge.mil</a>.</p>

<p><em>Mjasay</em> <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/02/01/1259203">writes on  slasldot</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The  US Department  of Defense,  which has  been flirting  with open
source for years as a way to improve software quality and cut costs,
has finally  burst the  dam on Defense-related  open-source adoption
with Forge.mil, an open-source code repository based on Sourceforge.
Though it currently only holds  three projects and is limited to DoD
personnel for  security reasons, all  code is publicly  viewable and
will almost  certainly lead to  other agencies participating  on the
site or  creating their  own.  Open source  has clearly come  a long
way. Years ago  studies declared open source a  security risk.  Now,
one of  the most security-conscious  organizations on the  planet is
looking to  open source to provide better  security than proprietary
alternatives.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very interesting  move if interpreted as the potential start
for  a &quot;planetary  intelligence&quot;, as  much as  open-source development
created  a planetary  dynamic that  spread horizontally  over national
boundaries.</p>

because mentioning the &quot;Funding  for the Development of Open Software&quot;
in  USA, apparently  a possible  concern on  the new  president's desk
Barack Obama.</p>

        <h2>Politics in Israel</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">Just before  the elections in Israel  and right after  the massacre of
civilians in Gaza, which also  included bombing of UN headquarters and
<a href="http://publish.indymedia.org.uk/en/2009/01/418249.html">public incitations to murder peace  activists</a>, it's maybe time to have
a look at  how reasonable people are doing over there.</p>

<p>One impressive  campaign is  <a href="http://december18th.org/">December 18th</a>: at  the motto of  FREE THE
SHMINISTIM&quot; young conscious objectors (among them also the daughter of
a former deputy  head of Mossad) stepped forward  and refused to serve
the omnipresent  militarization of Israel, the country  where they are
born and that still forces them to serve IDF for 2 to 3 years.</p>

<p>Since 20 years now (and finally) we had abolition of coercive military
service  for youth  in  Europe: this  is  definitely one  of the  most
important political standpoints  for Israel to work on,  if it intends
to get closer to Europe.</p>

<p>More on what the militarization of  Israel is doing to the soul of its
children is  poetically depicted by  the animation <a href="http://waltzwithbashir.com/">Waltz  with Bashir</a>,
the story of massacres in Sabra  and Shatila in the eyes and memory of
those who actually served the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre">IDF operated massacres in 1982</a>.</p>
