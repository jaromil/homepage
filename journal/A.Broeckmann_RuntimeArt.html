<p>Runtime Art: Software, Art, Aesthetics</p>

<p>Berlin, 24 May 2004</p>

<p><a href="http://runtimeart.mi2.hr/TextAndreasBroeckmann">http://runtimeart.mi2.hr/TextAndreasBroeckmann</a></p>

<p>I. Software as Art</p>

<p>For a  long time,  computer software has  been understood as  a purely
functional element  of digital technology. Only since  the late 1990s,
it  has come  under the  scrutiny  of media  theoretical and  cultural
research. After the age  of garage-based computer bricoleurs, followed
by  the massive  distribution  of personal  computers  that came  with
standard  proprietary   software  but  without   the  necessary  media
competency, the last years have been characterised by a growing 'do it
yourself'  culture  where  programmers  cooperate  internationally  on
writing free  software, and where musicians,  visual artists, literary
critics   and  architects   are  increasingly   acquiring  programming
know-how.</p>

<p>At the same time, we see the rise of a generation of media critics who
are  equally familiar  with the  Internet's technology,  standards and
politics, and with the marketing and techno-politics of computer hard-
and software. The debates of these media critics show that software is
a medium  and a cultural artefact  that is being design  in a specific
way which  carries a particular socio-cultural meaning.  In analogy to
the  cultural analysis  of technology  as it  has emerged  from social
historiography over  the past decades, we can  observe the exploration
of a technical medium being investigated with regard to the social and
economic conditions of its development and application.</p>

<p>Since  2001,  the   Berlin-based  international  media  art  festival,
transmediale, has been committed in  its programme to the cultural and
artistic  dimensions  of  software.  The transmediale  was  the  first
festival to award a special prize  for software art, and it has hosted
a  whole series of  discussions and  lectures in  order to  foster the
dialogue   between  programmers,   artists,  sociologists   and  media
researchers. This  initiative is not aimed at  installing software art
as yet another  independent art category, but is  meant as a heuristic
intervention that  seeks to stimulate the discourse  in this important
socio-cultural field. It  raises the question in how  far software art
can  be  described  as  a  form  of  'autonomous'  artistic  practice,
autonomous  that   is  of   the  normal  functional   and  utilitarian
requirements of software, and what might be the aesthetic potential of
the creative practice of programming.</p>

<p>In a text developed from their original jury statement, Florian Cramer
and Ulrike  Gabriel, who  were members of  the first  Software-Jury of
transmediale.01,  put  it like  this:  'Coding  is  a highly  personal
activity. Code can be  diaries, poetic, obscure, ironic or disruptive,
defunct or impossible,  it can simulate and disguise,  it has rhetoric
and  style, it  can  be an  attitude.  Such attributes  might seem  to
contradict the  fact that artistic control  over generative iterations
of   machine  code   is  limited,   whether  or   not  the   code  was
self-written. But unlike the Cagean artists of the 1960s, the software
artists  we reviewed  seem to  conceive of  generative systems  not as
negation  of  intentionality,  but  as  balancing  of  randomness  and
control. Program code thus becomes  a material with which artists work
self-consciously. Far from being simply art for machines, software art
is highly concerned with  artistic subjectivity and its reflection and
extension into generative systems.'</p>

<p>Most of what  constitutes software art today, belongs  in the field of
media  art, in  so far  as  it is  concerned with  the formulation  of
aesthetic  modes of  expression, with  the expansion  of  the artistic
field, and with the articulation of the shifting relationship of human
and  medium, or  human  and machine.  Software  programming will,  not
dissimilar to photography, video and  the Internet, move from a status
of novelty, on to being one  more medium which artists can make use of
according to  their individual  taste, expressive needs  and technical
faculties. A  software art  exhibition will then  make as much  and as
little sense  as an exhibition  dedicated to photographs, or  to video
art.</p>

<p>II. Software as Culture</p>

<p>Software  has by  now come  into view  as a  cultural  technique whose
social  and political  impact ought  to be  studied carefully.  To the
extent that  social processes rely  on software for their  execution -
from systems  of e-government and net-based  education, online banking
and shopping, to the organisation of social groups and movements -, it
is  necessary  to  understand  the  procedural  specificities  of  the
computer programmes  employed, and the cultural  and political 'rules'
coded  into  them.  The  ?killer  apps? of  tomorrow  may,  as  Howard
Rheingold claims,  not be 'hardware  devices or software  programs but
social practices'.  Yet, these  social practices will  increasingly be
determined by software  configurations of the available infrastructure
and  the degrees and  types of  latitude that  they offer.  Aspects of
software culture - a  terrain that encompasses software development as
well as  the wide and  multi-facetted field of software  application -
are being articulated by speculative and artistic software projects.</p>

<p>The term  'social software'  has been used  by Matthew  Fuller, Graham
Harwood, and others,  to describe a type of  software that consciously
engages  the social aspects  of its  application. Whereas  a programme
like  MS Word,  which Fuller  has carefully  disected in  an extensive
analysis, tends  to conceal the  rules and assumptions that  served to
constitute its  structure, social software addresses the  more or less
specific social context of its application, whether in the form of the
Linker software  by Mongrel  that offers an  easy-to-use functionality
for multimedia  production, or  in the online  communication platforms
that   support,  for  instance,   collaborative  software   and  media
development and that can easily be tweaked to meet the requirements of
a certain co-producer community.</p>

<p>For  almost a decade,  the Nettime  mailing list  has been  an active,
international  forum for the  discussion of  software-related cultural
and political issues. In a seminal essay posted on Nettime, Behind the
Blip,  Fuller talks  about key  aspects  of social  software and  also
refers to  the Californian researcher  Ellen Ullman who has  worked on
software  development  as a  distinctly  social  practice for  several
years. Important practical and theoretical work in this field has also
been done  by the  Amsterdam-based Society for  Old and New  Media, De
Waag, whose  software development projects have engaged  the needs and
possibilities  of  different  user  groups  by way  of  models  for  a
'participatory software design'. In  cooperation with De Waag, the New
Delhi-based media  and communication centre  Sarai has also  worked on
both the practical  issues of social software development,  and on the
critical reflection  of software  culture on their  online Reader-List
and in the Reader print  publications. While Nettime has often carried
postings  articulating  differences  between  European  and  US  media
cultures, Sarai  has, importantly, helped  to raise awareness  for the
differences in software cultures,  esp. with regard to developments in
South Asia.</p>

<p>In his  essay, Behind the  Blip (now also  available in a book  of the
same  title, published  by Autonomedia),  Fuller  distinguishes social
software from 'critical' and 'speculative' software, critical software
being 'software  designed explicitly to  pull the rug  from underneath
normalised  understandings of  software'. It  critically  engages with
existing  software  programmes  and  mutates  or  critically  analyses
them. In contrast, 'speculative software' comes closest to what can be
understood  as an  artistic approach  to  software: it  is, as  Fuller
writes,  'software  that explores  the  potentiality  of all  possible
programming. It creates transversal connections between data, machines
and  networks.  Software,  part   of  whose  work  is  to  reflexively
investigate itself as software. Software as science fiction, as mutant
epistemology. Speculative  software can be understood as  opening up a
space for the reinvention of software by its own means.'</p>

<p>In comparison, the notion of  'software art' is an attempt to describe
a  practice   that  is  artistic,   non-functionalist,  reflexive  and
speculative about  the aesthetics and  politics of software,  and that
takes  computer programming  as the  material proper  of  the artistic
practice.  The term  is especially  used for  works of  generative art
whose main artistic  material is program code, or  which deal with the
cultural understanding  of software. Thus, software  is not understood
as  a functional  tool  serving the  'real'  artistic work,  but as  a
generative   means   for  the   creation   of   machinic  and   social
processes. Software art, in  the understanding of researcher, software
activist and co-editor of the Nettime Unstable Digest, Florian Cramer,
can be the  result of an autonomous and  formal creative practice, but
it  can also refer  the cultural  and social  meaning of  software, or
reflect  on  existing  software  through strategies  like  collage  or
critique.</p>

<p>Like transmediale, other exhibition and curatorial projects (Generator
in the UK, the ars electronica's CODE festival, the exhibition 'I Love
You' on computer viruses, a.o.) have sought to circumscribe a field of
artistic   work   that  deals   with   the   aesthetic  potential   of
software.  Most notably,  the festival  Read_Me (Moscow,  Helsinki and
Arhus) has been exclusively devoted to software art and has led to the
establishment  of  the  Runme.Org  collaborative online  database  for
software  art projects.  The  CODeDOC project  has presented  software
developed by  artists and has  included comments and  documentation of
the programming process and has  thus attempted to introduce an aspect
of transparency  and the  idea of Open  Sources into the  discourse on
software by and for artists, an issue which is also being addressed in
discussions about  'open content' and the  'creative commons' licenses
for artistic  productions. In contrast, Free  Software developers like
Jaromil,  who is  pursuing  a.o. the  MuSE  project for  a free  audio
streaming  software, insist  on  the necessity  to resist  proprietary
licensing models altogether.</p>

<p>It is  worth noticing  that the Free  Software and open  source models
have increasingly also  influenced art-related software productions in
independent labs  like the V2_Lab,  the Ars Electronica Center  or the
MIT Media  Lab. The copyright  issue, which Georg Greve,  president of
the Free  Software Foundation Europe, suggests should  not be referred
to  as  'Intellectual  Property   Rights'  but  as  'the  question  of
industrial  control  of  information',  will become  crucial  for  the
information and knowledge society and must be addressed experimentally
in the arts and culture  sector, like in the recent exhibition Illegal
Art which presented some of  the ridiculous results of tight copyright
laws.</p>

<p>The issues  of interface  design and interaction  have been  among the
prime  concerns of  digital art  production, yet,  while  software has
mostly been treated as a tool towards realism in virtual environments,
software art projects like I/O/D's Webstalker, Jodi's Wrong Browers or
Joan Leandre's  retroYou R/C have offered  irritating and enlightening
insights  into  the  construction  of  digital  realism  by  means  of
software.</p>

<p>The  Internet, while  accelerating the  demise of  utopian  hopes once
invested in  its liberatory potential, has  also become the  site of a
multiplicity of collaborative forums, whether on mailing lists, Wikis,
in  weblog  communities,  etc.   For  the  Net  in  general,  software
developments  around Java,  the  Linux system,  and online  publishing
forums like  Slashdot or Freshmeat, have  all had shares  in a complex
and  vibrant cultural  development.  For software  art in  particular,
a.o., the eu-gene and linart  mailing lists, are continuing to play an
important role. The social and theoretical implications of these kinds
of  online  cooperation have  been  investigated  by  projects of  the
interdisciplinary artists group Knowbotic Research for over ten years,
most notably in the IO_dencies series  in the mid-90s, but also in the
more  recent collaborative  hacking projects.  Similarly,  the Italian
EpidemiC  collective  explores  new  forms of  software  based  online
activism in their Anti-Mafia project.</p>

<p>Collaborative and activist projects like these frequently also involve
debates about network security, ironically referenced by Technology To
The People's  Phoney(TM), and about privacy issues  which were tackled
by  LAN's Tracenoizer  project and,  more recently,  by  Franz Alken's
Machines Will Eat Itself, both of which instigate a deliberate erosion
of relations between human individuals and their online data bodies.</p>

<p>If  anything, software  art projects  like these  should  indicate the
necessity  to delve  more deeply  into the  cultural  specificities of
software development and application.  Software needs to be understood
as a  set of digital media  which need to be  explored regarding their
specificity,  their  political  and  cultural dimensions.  An  immense
amount of knowhow already exists  in the open source and free software
development  communities,   as  well  as  in  hacker   and  art  coder
circles. It  will be crucial  to devise ways  how this knowhow  can be
interwoven, at times  pooled, and exploded across the  entire field of
software development and usage.</p>

<p>III. Notes about the Aesthetics of Software Art</p>

<p>When  talking  about  software  and   art,  we  have  to  speak  about
aesthetics,  that  is  engage   the  value  systems  that  inform  our
experience  of art, and  our perceptions  in general.  References have
been made  to the  traditions of Fluxus,  Conceptual Art, or  Net Art,
each of which implies a set  of assumptions about the ways in which to
judge  the artistic  quality of  artworks.  Over the  last 200  years,
European  culture has  seen aesthetics  of beauty,  aesthetics  of the
sublime, aesthetics  of ugliness, and aesthetics of  formal order. But
this  history   teaches  us,  that  there  are   alternative  ways  of
approaching  software-based   artworks  than  Max   Bense's  extremely
formalistic  &quot;Generative   Aesthetik&quot;  which  he   formulated  in  the
1960s.  For instance,  it would  also  be interesting  to revisit  the
debates about  Realism vs Formalism  between Lukacs and Brecht  in the
1930s in this respect, if only to sharpen our perception for the level
of critique that can be brought to significant artworks.</p>

<p>My  own idea of  art practice,  which I  also bring  to this  field of
software-based   work,  is   opposed  to   bland   visualisations  and
translations from one formal system to another. I believe that we need
a strong  notion of  what constitutes  art. For me,  art is  about the
transgression  of   boundaries,  about  making   familiar  experiences
strange,  about dramatising what  pretends to  be innocent,  and about
exploring  the virtualities,  the potentialities  of  technologies and
human relationships.</p>

<p>In  many cases,  art  projects  relate to  or  express their  cultural
environment  in very restrained  or benign,  at times  even banalising
ways. This is not only an  issue in software-based art, but of digital
art practice  in general  - it  often tends to  be affirmative  of the
technology, uncritical  of its  corporate politics and  superficial in
its formulations  and expressions. Where  is the desire for  excess in
software-based art? Where  do we find the surplus,  the surprise, that
which  we do  not know  yet and  that is  not already  legible  in the
software  code or  the technical  dispositif that  artists  prepare so
ardently?</p>

<p>IV. Runtime Art</p>

<p>For  the  exhibition 'Runtime  Art',  we  have  selected a  number  of
projects  that  engage  specifically  with  one  aspect  of  software,
i.e. its  execution in  the 'runtime' of  the computer  processor, and
thus the close connection between code execution and aesthetics.</p>

<p>A classic piece in this respect  is Every Icon by John F. Simon, which
exhibits  both  the precise  clock-speed  of  the  computer that  runs
through the iterations of black and white pixels in a binary grid, and
the impossibility  of a comprehensive  representation of reality  by a
computer which, quite apparently, already  fails in the simple task of
offering  all  possible  computer  icons  in a  reasonable  amount  of
time. While 'Every Icon' dramatises the execution of code by the sheer
tedium  of its almost  endless process,  Vexation1 by  Antoine Schmitt
achieves  a  more singular  tension  by  giving  the impression  of  a
hesitant, self-conscious computer program  that 'drags its feet' as it
has  to  decide   which  path  a  white  dot   should  take  from  one
pre-determined side of the rectangle  to the next. Despite the clearly
given  determinacy,  the program  still  appears  to  be caught  in  a
subjective decision-making process.</p>

<p>For his project  Micro Images, Casey Reas has  developed a complex set
of algorithms that send the generative graphics into unpredictable and
hugely  complex  configurations.  Here,  'runtime' is  the  medium  of
excessive machine-based differentiation.  A similar task is approached
very  differently in  the project  Electric Sheep  by Scott  Draves, a
screen-saver  program   that  takes  its  calculating   power  from  a
distributed network  of computers running the  software generating the
graphics which can be individually designed and viewed. The 'excess of
runtime' is also explored in Mandl &amp; Krautgasser's Pedigree which uses
the  actual written code  to translate  the story  of Oedipus  into an
algorithmic   language  which,   when  executed,   offers   a  dynamic
representation of the  Oedipal drama of Love and  Death in multiplying
triangulations of relationships.</p>

<p>The question of  the interface through which human  users can interact
with  software-based systems  has  been approached  very elegantly  by
Golan Levin. His Audio-Visual Environment  Suite (AVES) is a series of
tools for the  gestural creation and manipulation of  sonic and visual
structures.  More analytical  in  its approach  is  the Webstalker  by
I/O/D,  one of the  first projects  to deconstruct  the notion  of the
web-browser: the Webstalker offers several ways of looking at the code
and link structure of a  website, giving access to all the information
that a regular browser would also show, and more, but in a way that is
formal  and purely structural.  While the  Webstalker was  designed in
opposition  to   existing  representational  models,   Minitasking  by
Schoenerwissen/OfCD had  to invent its  own representational paradigms
for a structure that had not been visualised before, i.e. the Gnutella
file-sharing network.  Minitasking combines the function  of a crawler
with  that  of a  network  scanner, offering  a  complex  image and  a
functional  interface  to  an  ongoing,  internet-based  communication
system.</p>

<p>Such   representational   models   are   called  into   questions   by
Auto-Illustrator,  a  software   package  developed  by  Signwave  and
modelled on existing vector  graphics programs. Unlike those, however,
'Auto-Illustrator' exhibits  a distinct autonomy  in the visualisation
of commands and movements of  the user, which it frequently translates
into crazy and uncontrolled results, thus highlighting the fundamental
difference between intention,  user-interaction, and result. A similar
deconstructive approach is  taken by Joan Leandre in  the retroYou R/C
project  which,   on  its   different  racing  game   levels,  employs
increasingly  corrupted rules  for the  representation of  the virtual
environment in  which the  race is taking  place. True to  its slogan,
&quot;F*ck  the gravity code!&quot;,  it pinpoints  both the  constructedness of
such  virtual  3D-spaces,  and   the  limitations  of  interaction  in
non-rational spaces.</p>

<p>Finally,  a  project by  Robert  Luxemburg  exemplifies the  political
dimension of  digital data and their execution.  The Conceptual Crisis
of Private Property  as a Crisis in Practice is  a screen-shot, i.e. a
digital image,  whose code can  also be executed  as a program  - when
executed,  the  file  produces   the  novel  'Cryptonomicon'  by  Neal
Stephenson.   The   project   is   a  riddle   about   the   different
representational and  juridical layers at  which coded, and  thus also
encoded intellectual property, can  exist. Here, 'runtime' is not only
the condition,  but the problematic  medium, interface and  gateway to
the borders of representation and legality.</p>

<p>This selection of works covers  the particular field of generative art
and is  in no way  exhaustive, and certainly  not for all the  ways in
which software  is currently being explored  as a medium  and theme of
artistic practice. These  include a whole range of  projects, from the
exploration   of  code   as  poetry,   through   the  psychogeographic
programming   of  cities  by   socialfiction.org,  to   the  real-time
programming   environments   developed   for  live   performance   and
interaction tasks.  In this entire  field, artists are no  longer just
working  within existing  technological paradigms,  but  through their
creative  programming efforts, they  are actually  trying to  push the
boundaries  of   what  software  means   as  a  social   and  cultural
technique. The  cooperation between  artists and programmers  is often
very close,  and in many of  the examples presented  here, the artists
have in fact done the programming themselves.</p>

<p>The  exhibition 'Runtime Art'  is an  exploration into  the generative
aesthetics of software. Rather than being conclusive, it hopes to open
up  further   debate  about   the  artistic  potentials   of  computer
programming and digital code as cultural artifacts, and techniques.</p>
