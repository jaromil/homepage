        <h2>RIP Harold Pinter</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">Harold Pinter died, yesterday.</p>

<p>The last  time I've heard  him, we were  in London's Hyde park  at the
Peace march in  2003 protesting against a war  that started anyway, in
the name  of democracy.  We  were millions in  the streets of  all the
World on that day, marching against war in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>


<p>But no.  Our governments joined  the war anyway.  Our soldiers are out
there  far from  their families,  and today  is Christmas,  and Harold
Pinter is dead.  And I remember  clearly now his cry for peace. I feel
how little  sense our present has  in Europe. In  the Netherlands they
don't even know why the state  joined the war in Afghanistan, they are
still trying to  understand under which pressure the  militars and the
government actually did join, who signed the papers...</p>


<p>Harold Pinter was a  great man. He had the guts to  say things as they
are, to face babylon with its  own crimes and hypocrisy, while his own
talent and  integrity are recognised  worldwide, by a Nobel  Prize and
much more than that.</p>

<p>He  was  not an  elitist  even  if his  talent  made  him  part of  an
intellectual elite,  and he had never  a doubt to say  things, even if
horrible to  be said.  He admittedly could  make mistakes, but  I feel
most things  he did were  right, he was  right to the point  on things
people didn't dare to be.</p>

<p>Let's all spend a few hours reading his words resting in our libraries
please.  Lets meditate how many compromises are we doing in the things
we aren't  saying, in  the moderated comfort  we are all  swimming in,
with the  privilege of our  brains and what  we can understand  of the
world and what we prefer to not say, for our own interest. How much is
worth a single  life, the life of  many people, the life of  a man who
dares like Harold Pinter did.</p>

<p>Below some  original Pinter's  quotes that will  surely be  deleted by
revisionists:</p>

<p>he has  called the President of  the United States, George  W. Bush, a
&quot;mass murderer&quot; and  the (then) Prime Minister of  the United Kingdom,
Tony  Blair,  both &quot;mass-murdering&quot;  and  a  &quot;deluded  idiot&quot; and  has
described them,  along with past  U.S. officials, as  &quot;war criminals.&quot;</p>

<p>Pinter characterized Blair's Great Britain as &quot;pathetic and supine,&quot; a
&quot;bleating little lamb  tagging behind [the United States]  on a lead.&quot;
According  to   Pinter,  Blair  was   participating  in  &quot;an   act  of
premeditated  mass  murder&quot;  instigated  on behalf  of  &quot;the  American
people,&quot; who,  Pinter notes, increasingly  protest &quot;their government's
actions&quot; (Public reading from War, as qtd. by Chrisafis and Tilden)</p>

<p>Pinter published  his remarks to the mass  peace protest demonstration
held on 15 February 2003, in London, on his website:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;The United States is a  monster out of control. Unless we challenge
it with absolute determination  American barbarism will destroy the
world. The  country is  run by a  bunch of criminal  lunatics, with
Blair as their hired Christian  thug. The planned attack on Iraq is
an act of premeditated mass murder&quot; (&quot;Speech at Hyde Park&quot;).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those  remarks  anticipate his  2005  Nobel  Lecture,  &quot;Art, Truth,  &amp;
Politics&quot;, in which he observes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;Many thousands,  if not  millions, of people  in the  United States
itself  are  demonstrably sickened,  shamed  and  angered by  their
government's actions, but  as things stand they are  not a coherent
political force yet. But the anxiety, uncertainty and fear which we
can  see  growing  daily  in  the  United  States  is  unlikely  to
diminish&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where he had  foreseen Obama campaign, for a  government that now owes
to Pinter's  life all the  coherence that it  takes to finally  make a
real change. Furthermore, speaking to Europe and Latin America, Pinter
exhorted  the mostly  European audience  &quot;to resist  the power  of the
United States,&quot; stating:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;I'd  like  to  see Europe  echo  the  example  of Latin  America  in
withstanding the  economic and political intimidation  of the United
States. This is  a serious responsibility for Europe  and all of its
citizens&quot; (Qtd.  in Anderson and Billington, Harold Pinter 428).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And  i must  confess this  last quote  reads so  sad  considering what
Europe really is, probably that's  the bigger mistake he has ever made
in his discourse.</p>

<p>rest in peace, Harold Pinter.</p>

<p>During these holy days i'm spending  a big deal of time networking and
gathering info on the <a href="http://jaromil.dyne.org/journal/coltan_and_blood.html">Coltan and Blood</a> issue, a panel we'll be running
at next  Transmediale, coming  january.  I wish  to dedicate  all this
effort to Harold  Pinter today, we shall do all  our best to continue,
to continue  saying what cannot be  told, right here, in  the belly of
the  monster.  I'm  reading  things  that cannot  be  said so  easily,
thinking of him now gives all the strenght needed to continue.</p>

<p>rest in peace, Harold Pinter.</p>

the  house at  the eviction  of the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungdomshuset">Ungdomshuset</a>, got  sentenced to
imprisonment.  11 people  sentenced to  1 year  and three  months, 3
people to one year and one (aged under 16) to nine months!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an  outrageous episode for all those  who care about liberties
for the  youth to express  and self-organise.  These young  people are
criticising  capitalism,  state  repression,  religious  hegemony  and
claiming  their own social  space within  a city  that, as  many other
cities,  doesn't  offers agency  for  social  interaction  out of  the
planned schemes and the omnipresent State of Control.</p>

<p>As   it  is   manifest  on   <a href="http://www.ungeren.dk">their  website</a>,   their   activities  are
non-conformed, reflecting the repression and marginalisation they face
in  developing their  own values:  rebellion for  necessity,  vegan in
response to the inhumanity of the food industry, anti-fascist to fight
back what we have been (and we are still) going through, etc. etc.</p>

<p>These  are young people  that decided  to develop  their society  in a
different  way,  still being  denied  to  do  so: evicted  from  their
building  (&quot;legally&quot;  owned  by  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faderhuset">some church</a>),  persecuted  for  their
beliefs (from which  we can still learn a  lot about living together),
forced  into a  system  that exploits  their  labour without  offering
anything back, not even the freedom to live together.</p>

<p>What the persecutors seems to  not understand is that this youth won't
give up  - and  rightfully so: since  they have  the right to  build a
different  world for themselves,  after the  &quot;adults&quot; have  ruined the
present one already, in the eyes of their own kids.</p>

<p>This conflict will just make  things worst for everyone: the &quot;problem&quot;
will stay (and grow with  more systemic problems) tainting the genuine
growth  of new  people and  their sincere  research for  solutions, as
their need to defend a few liberated spaces will turn into violence to
survive.</p>

<p>Good <em>brico</em> attitude  and lots of neat results! In  Europe there are so
few people recycling that the aesthetic patterns of such practices are
mostly  limited to  punk and  new-age ,  but this  website  shows that
designers can move in many more directions along these lines.</p>

mentioned earlier in  this research, funded by the  EU Commissions 7th
Framework Program (FP7).</p>

<p>Its aims  are well shaped  after the &quot;P2P revolution&quot;,  nothing really
new to those  of us already working on  (deployed) distributed network
protocols and visions  as <a href="http://hivenetworks.net/tiki-view_articles.php">hivenetworks</a>, <a href="http://www.olsr.org/">olsrd</a>, <a href="http://www.open-mesh.net/">B.A.T.M.A.N.</a>, <a href="http://www.netsukuku.org">netsukuku</a>
and of course bittorrent.</p>

<p>But!  NADA  plans to  patent its results.   And how?  since  in Europe
software patents  aren't legal?  we'll see, meanwhile  in the &quot;Related
Projects -&gt;  Security&quot; section  on their website  is well  visible the
research  on  &quot;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/can-you-trust.html">trusted computing</a>&quot;  to  limit  liberties and  establish
monopolies rather than preserve security.</p>

<p>What a <strong>restrictive attitude for a publicly funded project</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Schiphol people, wij gaan!</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">Today  <a href="http://m2m.streamtime.org">M2M  Radio</a>  launched  an  international  press  release  titled
<strong>European Court of Human Rights admits case against Dutch ministers for
Schiphol Fire</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The European Court of Human  Rights in Strasbourg has informed Dutch
lawyer  Mr.N.M.P.   Steijnen  that   the  Court  has   admitted  the
application  against two former  Dutch ministers,  or the  State, in
relation with the  Schiphol Fire.  This fire on  the 26th of October
2005 killed  eleven detained migrants  in a detention center  on the
premises  of  Hollands  main  Schiphol  airport.   Mr.  Steijnen  is
pressing  these charges  representing committee  of non-governmental
organizations,  survivors  and  relatives  of the  deceased  against
Mr.  J.P.H. (Piet  Hein) Donner,  who was  at the  time  minister of
Justice (and today of social affairs) and against Mrs. M.C.F. (Rita)
Verdonk,  who   was  at  the   time  Minister  of   Immigration  and
Integration. They  are charged with cruel  and humiliating treatment
(Art.3 ECHR)  of both  the killed inmates  and the survivors  of the
fire.  Donner  is held  responsible  for  the  construction and  the
management  of the  complex,  while  Verdonk was  in  charge of  the
administrative  detention  of   undocumented  migrants  and  of  the
treatment  of the survivors  after the  fire.  The  European Court's
decision brings this procedure now to the international level, after
the Dutch  legal instances have decided against  prosecuting, on the
grounds that  servants of  the state cannot  be held  accountable in
person. The independent Dutch  Security Board concluded in 2006 that
the disaster  would have  been much smaller  if the  authorities had
lived up  to the  regulations. As a  consequence of this  report two
Ministers  then  resigned,  Donner  and  Mrs.  Dekker  (Housing  and
Environment). Verdonk remained in office  and is now heading her own
populist,  right-wing  party  &quot;Trots  op Nederland&quot;  (Proud  of  the
Netherlands).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The only one man being prosecuted in relation to the Fire will stand
to  appeal  in  the  coming   months.   The  accused  is  Ahmed  Isa
Al-J(eballi), a migrant  from Libya, who was detained  in Block K of
the Detention  Center of  Schiphol East in  order to  be transported
back to his native country. In the night of the 26th of October 2005
a fire took place in this Block, which killed eleven inmates.  Ahmed
Isa is  charged for setting  fire to his  cell by throwing  away his
cigarette butt before  falling asleep.  In 2006 he  was condemned to
three years of  confinement by the Court of  Haarlem for causing the
fire and  thus killing eleven  people and severely  wounding fifteen
others. The judge thereby endorsed the argumentation of the District
Attorney that  Ahmed Isa  consciously took the  risk of  causing the
disaster  by negligently  throwing away  his  cigarette: conditional
intent.   The technical  evidence is  highly disputed  and  is under
revision  by   an  expert  team   at  the  University   of  Lausanne
(Switzerland).   There is  serious  evidence that  the fire  started
elsewhere  in Block  K.   The  chance that  the  particular type  of
cigarette the accused was smoking  could effectively start a fire is
very  small. It  was  a roll-your-own  &quot;shaggie&quot;  rolled with  paper
called Blue  Rizla, known to  extinguish rapidly. Last  December two
experts, Prof. Wagenaars  en Koppen, pointed out that  the memory of
the  accused,  particularly  his   admitting  that  he  pitched  his
cigarette that very evening of the fire, is highly unreliable.  This
is  another major  blow  for the  persecutor,  comments Ahmed  Isa's
lawyer mr. Eduard Damman.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">However, the fundamental argument against the ruling of the court is
a political one: even if it were true that Ahmed Isa caused the fire
then the Dutch State has done everything to make it possible for his
cigarette  to  create  a  major  disaster. Basically  the  state  is
responsible for those detained in their facilities. The building and
safety regulations had been neglected  and the training level of the
personnel was substandard.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><strong>Free Ahmed Isa = Justice for All Survivors</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cause of  justice for all survivors boils down to  the case of the
only  man that  has been  accused so  far: Ahmed  isa  Al-J(eballi). A
proper  administration of  justice is  of the  highest  importance for
their well being and indeed for their lives. Therefore M2M Radio calls
on international law experts to  monitor this case.  There are several
reasons to seek international monitoring of the upcoming proceedings:</p>

<ul>
<li>The International dimension: the  victims of the Schiphol Fire are
citizens of at least thirty five different countries around the world.</li>

<li>The disaster happened in the domain of administrative law aimed at
tackling irregular migration in the Netherlands.  The Dutch government
has been criticized in many  instances both by the European Court, the
Commission for the Prevention of  Torture and Inhuman Treatment of the
European Council  and by  Amnesty International for  not living  up to
internationally established standards of rule of law and human rights.</li>

<li>The Dutch State is party in this case and therefore it is doubtful
if it can guarantee a fair trial.</li>

<li>The case of the  Schiphol Fire has severely damaged the confidence
of many citizens in the democracy of the Netherlands.</li>

<li>Finally,  not  only  the  accused, but  also  the  survivors  and
relatives of the dead, are suffering until this day from the physical,
material  and  psychological  consequences   of  the  fire.  A  proper
administration of justice is of  the highest importance for their well
being and indeed their lives.

<p>To facilitate the monitoring M2M Radio will produce live coverage of
the    trial    and    parallel    sessions   on    the    internet:

found dead in a lava-formed pit on top of the Volcano.</p>

<p>His story is striking as  he died pursuing a dangerous and fascinating

<p>It is deeply touching to look  now at what <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasreichart">Thomas could upload online</a>.
His  passion  pushed  him over  the  limits  of  his own  body,  still
realising a beautiful net-based art piece.</p>

<p>What Thomas  left us online  unleashes a deep dramaturgy  for net.art,
carried  by  the ubiquitous  availability  of  such intense  pictures,

        <h2>Spinoza in Amsterdam</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">I was invited  to join today's debate in  Amsterdam, about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza">Spinoza</a> and
the  meaning  of Freedom,  organised  by  <a href="http://coolpolitics.nl">coolpolitics.nl</a>.  After  two
interesting lectures by Jeroen Bartels and Hans Achterhuis, the public
participated in  a debate  that saw me  sitting besides Boris  van der
Ham, Arendo Joustra and Ahmed Aynan.</p>

<p>It was  somehow boring to  over-discuss &quot;freedom of speech&quot;  topics as
publication  of  Fitna, still  I  did my  best  to  progress into  the
analysis of the <a href="http://www.networkcultures.org/_uploads/notebook2_theinternetofthings.pdf">Internet of Things</a>, the future of property in a &quot;truly
liberal&quot;  sense and  the monopolistic  role  of the  industry in  this
regards. As  there wasn't enough space  for all the  topics that could
have been raised, I'll do my best to elaborate further here.</p>

<p>I argued that neo-liberism is betraying its own roots, as Adam Smith's
openness  is contradicted  by the  enclosure of  consumer  objects and
their  creative   potentials.   In  fact  I'd  love   to  complete  my
declaration stating that <strong>today neo-liberism is dead</strong>: exactly 120 years
after the birth of Harpo Marx  on 23 november 1888, one day before the
anniversary of  Spinoza's birth, neo-liberism is buried  under its own
unrealisation, failing to survive its lies, drained by a market crisis
we are all witnessing, buried by a progressive analysis on the damages
consumerism brought to our societies.</p>

<p>Regarding free speech and the  role of artists, topic that was debated
unfortunately also  in relation  to the youtube-collage  called Fitna,
let me quote <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy">Bansky</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;The thing I hate the most about advertising is that it attracts all
the bright,  creative and ambitious young people,  leaving us mainly
with the slow and self-obsessed to become our artists. Modern art is
a disaster  area.  Never in the  field of human history  has so much
been used by so many to say so little.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And  it was  a  pleasure to  hear the  wisdom  of an  elder among  the
audience  reminding  how pervasive  is  advertisement (and  industrial
rhetoric  I'd say)  in the  cultural debate,  a position  I  linked to
philosopher Herbert Marcuse for his <a href="http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/64onedim/odmcontents.html">One-Dimensional Man</a> essay: this is
such an important reflection today, explicitly dealing with <strong>freedom of
desire</strong>,  a  concept  that  is  well  contextual  to  Spinoza's  corpus
teoreticus.</p>

<p>All in all it felt that, besides the natural tendency of the debate to
stick to  old and abused  topics, the audience also  nurtured interest
for a progressive  analysis on property and the  novel models proposed
by the  free software movement. I  was surprised by a  public that was
some  generations older  than mine  and  that can  wisely unfold  such
analysis: more  than ever  now I believe  free software  benefits from
being discussed in a  philosophical context.  As more initiatives will
be held  next year  in Amsterdam about  Spinoza I'll be  interested to
follow  the discussion, especially  when it  will focus  on everyone's
freedom in this world, <strong>the  freedom to imagination and desire</strong>, not the
smart arrogance of a few  populist politicians to offend religions and
provoke hatred.</p>

        <h2>Anomalous Wave of student protests</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p><em>Onda  Anomala</em>  is the  name  choosen  by  italian students  mobilising
against  privatisation  of schools  and  rising  prices for  education
promoted  by  the  new  decree of  Mariastella  Gelmini,  Berlusconi's
minister  for education.   The main  slogan  is strong  and can  touch
everyone's hear:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">WE WON'T PAY FOR YOUR CRISIS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Progressively,  the  youth in  Europe  is  recognising the  precarious
future  that previous  generations have  left: more  young  people are
acknowledging  the results  of financial  and ecological  disasters in
their own lives - and many  know who the responsible are.</p>

<p>It  is a  common  thought  this crisis  being  provoked by  widespread
incompetence and corruption of the so called &quot;neo-liberist&quot; leaders: a
ruling cast that has substituted  ethics with personal profit, that is
now finally  declining, leaving a dramatic trail  of privatised social
services,  a deregulated  economy  in  agony and  <em>dulcis  in fundo</em>  an
emergency plan  to save  its own failure  stealing resources  from the
social welfare, most importantly the education field.</p>

<p>This is  what is  happening in  Italy, as usual  for politics  in this
country,  in  a   very  intense  and  outrageous  way   -  while  more
international  youth  movements  are  sharing this  analysis,  quickly
propagating  the uprisings  on a  wider scale.</p>

<p>Here is the first <a href="documents/anomalous_wave-eng-nov08.pdf">Anomalous wave  pamphlet</a> in english, for you to read

<p>Also interesting Johan  Söderberg's <a href="http://giss.tv/dmmdb/contents/1776974245perspectiveonhacking-dl.ogg">&quot;conflict perspective</a>&quot; on hacking,
opening a reflection on unionism and hacker communities.</p>

      <p class="first">While  Riding an  18  hours long  bus trip  on  my way  to the  <a href="http://fscons.org">FSCONS</a>
conference  in  Goteborg,  our  vehicle  was checked  by  polizei  for
passenger's passport before embarking on the ferry to Denmark.</p>

<p>As two  men were found without  papers, the cop told  them in english:
&quot;end of the journey&quot; and abducted them outside, into a police van. The
sans-papiers  had a  southern look,  black curly  hair,  somehow mixed
traits between balcan and mediterranean physiognomies.</p>

<p>No other  passenger in the bus  was explained where  these people were
brought and  for how long;  it was just  a <em>clean removal</em>,  a situation
where  everyone   was  put  on  hold,  denying   any  solidarity,  any
sentiments, any feelings, any questions.</p>

<p>Most people  in the  bus were  migrants, still no  one related  to the
event, looking like nothing had  just happened, as if the cops flashed
us with some short-memory deletion device.</p>

<p>It is  not the first  time I'm witnessing  a border arrest,  but still
every  time it  feels  closer, as  the  cop indulges  on  my worn  out
passport, prolonged to last until 2012 without biometrics.</p>

        <h2>Italian school's liberty violated</h2>
      </div>

    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">In Rome  the State  University &quot;La Sapienza&quot;  has been occupied  by an
assembly  of  5.000  students,  following with  a  demonstration  that
counted 10.000 on the streets.</p>

<p>Students  and   citizens  are  protesting   against  privatisation  of
education,  which is demolishing  the public  school system  in Italy,
under the  extreme rush of neo-liberist government.</p>

<p>In  this situation  of turmoil  Berlusconi declared  that  police will
intervene in  schools, while Francesco Cossiga,  Honorary President of
the  Italian Republic  and  Senator  for life,  literally  said in  an
interview:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;Maroni  should  do exactly  what  I did  when  I  was minister  for
Internal Affairs. In the first  place, he should just leave the high
school students  alone, because, just  think what would happen  if a
youngster were  to be killed  or seriously injured... Leave  them be
(the  university students  - Ed).  Pull  the Police  forces off  the
streets  and out  of  the  University, then  send  in some  “agents
provocateurs” to  infiltrate the movement,  people that are  up for
anything and  leave the  demonstrators for about  ten days or  so to
ravage  the  shops,  set fire  to  vehicles  and  lay waste  to  the
cities. Then, having gained the  support of the public, the sound of
the ambulance  sirens must  drown out the  sirens of the  Police and
Carabinieri vehicles.  This is because  the forces of law  and order
should not show any pity whatsoever  and should send the lot of them
to  hospital.  Don’t  arrest  them,  after all,  the  judges  would
immediately allow them back onto  the streets. Rather, you must beat
them and also beat up those lecturers that are spurring the students
on.  The lecturers  above all.  I’m  not saying  the elderly  ones,
certainly, but  the little girl  teachers yes... this is  the recipe
for democracy: put out the flames before the fire takes over &quot;.</p>

<p>Reason  of the  censorship  was &quot;<em>Freeware  software</em>&quot;.   Result of  the

      <p class="first">A  <a href="http://trovacinema.repubblica.it/news/dettaglio/articolo/351914">polemic  exploded  in  Italy</a>,   moved  forward  by  the  ANPI  (the
association  of partisans  who  fought to  liberate  the country  from
fascism) regarding the facts Spike  Lee told in his new movie &quot;Miracle
in St.Anna&quot;.   Quoting the vice-president of the  ANPI in Pietrasanta,
Giovanni Cipollini:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The declarations  of Spike  Lee are offending  us.  What he  said is
demonstrating that he willingly  realized a film without taking into
consideration  the truth  of what  really happened  in  Sant'Anna di
Stazzema.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spike Lee has so far refused  any dialogue with witnesses of the facts
he is representing  in his fiction; the old  partisans are offended by
elements of fantasy in the story, for example when in the movie one of
them betrays  his Companeros,  a crucial moment  in the  fiction which
never really happened in history.</p>

<p>Another offensive point is that  the movie suggests the partisans used
the civilian population to shield themselves, supporting a rhetoric of
war that tries to shed negative light on grassroot civilian resistance
against aggression.</p>

<p>In solidarity with all the people  who fought and gave their lives for
my own  freedom, I feel  deluded too. I  guess this story can  go well
along with  the essay of  Rana Dasgupta about  Hollywood's revisionism
and how it is harming society and its memory.</p>

    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">Twenty-five years ago,  on the 27 September 1983,  Richard M. Stallman
shared a plan to create a completely free operating system called GNU.</p>

<p>For the  25th anniversary of the  GNU project, which  during the years
spawned a word-wide movement of hackers engaged to liberate users from
mental  slavery  and  corporate  monopolies, RMS  wrote  an  important
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/compromise.html">statement about compromises we shouldn't do</a>, explaining why it is more
and more important to keep focus on the originating principles and how
difficult that is becoming nowadays.</p>

<p>It  is getting harder  as it  goes on,  as a  big share  of visibility
generated by our efforts is nowadays in the hegemony of commercial and
billion-funded &quot;philanthropic&quot;  ventures that are  often neglecting to
properly  represent and respect  the social  and political  aspects of
this movement, as well its grassroot nature.</p>

<p>This statement was very much needed, what I understand is that we must
keep in balance  and well focused on a long  term strategy to preserve
the fundamental  principles of the GNU project  alive, protecting them
from a  growing amount of manipulations,  of which a few  can still be
acceptable  and  useful to  spread  our  social  concerns in  multiple
contexts.</p>

largest bank failure in history.</p>

<p>We  are talking  about a  hole  of $307  billions in  assets, with  an
expected domino effect as <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-Failed_Banks-sort.html">more banks will be following</a>.</p>

<p>Recently i got more  insterested in financial systems, looking forward
to the day when our generation will finally have a word on new ways to
shape economy - and seems that day is getting closer.</p>

<p>We all know  about the financial crisis, but  what is most interesting
is the way the mainstream media are presenting it: hiding failures (as
in the WAMU  case) and advertising all kind  of optimistic initiatives
to &quot;save  the market&quot;, all surprisingly backed  by state intervention.
The collusion  between media  and finance leads  into a dirty  game of
misinformation.</p>

      <p class="first">With this article titled <a href="http://www.expatica.com/be/life_in/feature/Prophet-vs-profit_-brewing-monks-pay-price-of-success--.html">Prophet  vs profit: dilemma for brewing monks</a>
Belgian news report the inspiring  case of the Trappist monks, brewing
a beer that is well known for its excellence.</p>

<p>The dilemma is that, on the  wave of their success, they should choose
between  scaling  their  production  to  industrial  level  or  remain
artisans  and  miss to  satisfy  the  growing  demand, giving  up  the
opportunity for profit.</p>

<p>I like their statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The main  reason for  refusing (to produce  more) is that  the monks
attach  enormous  importance to  a  limited  production  on a  human
scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Enjoying  all the  inspiring meanings  attached to  the  definition of
<strong>human scale</strong> in this and other  contexts. I just hope one doesn't needs
to be a monk to nurture such good principles in life.</p>

      <p class="first">Rana Dasgupta posted on nettime <a href="http://mail.kein.org/pipermail/nettime-l/2008-September/000797.html">his new extremely interesting essay</a> on
art history  - and how history gets  changed, and art as  well, by the
&quot;creative  industries&quot;.   I'll quote  here  its  conclusions, while  i
really suggest to read it in its completeness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">That the great artists of  modern Western culture managed to produce
what they did, despite the danger and intensity of their effort, was
due in large part to improvised social forms built around close-knit
networks where thought and affect circulated with high velocity, and
where it  was possible  to try out  forms of  non-conventional human
relationships that would not destroy, nor be destroyed by, a life of
art.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">In the second  half of the twentieth century,  many of the functions
of  these  networks  were  taken  over  in  Europe  by  institutions
(government funding bodies, universities,  museums, etc) and much of
their excessive feeling was neutralised.  This was only a small part
of a  general process of the  time: the absorption  of human emotion
into bureaucratic channels, and  the emergence of a social coolness,
an  efficiency  of feeling.  [...]  In order  to  arrive  at such  a
standardised,  manageable conception  of  creativity, much  previous
knowledge about this field of human activity must be sacrificed.</p>

considering local  free software initiatives when  acquiring IT goods,
basically violating antitrust principles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">From February to  June 2008, FACIL has noticed  sales of proprietary
software for more than 25 million dollars. These purchases were made
for  products offered  by large  multinational enterprises,  with no
regard  to  suppliers  in  Quebec.  These purchases  hurt  the  Free
Software  suppliers throughout  Quebec and  are an  obstacle  to the
development of  Quebec IT enterprises. FACIL  contests these methods
as the association believes they are illegal and unacceptable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nowadays it is widely known that a strategic Free Software utilization
in public administration  could create thousands of jobs  as well as a
significant decrease  in software licensing  costs.  However, Quebec's
public administration (and still many others around the World) refuses
to even consider and evaluate these options.</p>

      <p class="first">The <a href="http://www.gpgpu.org">GPGPU</a>  website introduces  the efforts of  a few people  trying to
re-use  accelerated graphic  hardware for  generic tasks,  using GPUs:
CPUs built for graphics...  they compute eh.</p>

<p>Today     there     was      a     buzz     on     slashdot,     about
&quot;<a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/08/19/2312234">New  Multi-GPU Technology  With  No Strings  Attached</a>, meaning  that
another company  is trying to  break in business with  a open-hardware
&quot;<em>no strings attached&quot;</em> product.</p>

<p>I think there can be a  good market for Lucid Logix and hopefully some
future for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLSL">GLSL  initiative</a>, considering that the current monopoly
on  access  to  GPUs is  in  the  hands  of  Micros...  guess  who  :)
appropriating the creations of young  asian geniuses as in <a href="http://www.kunzhou.net/#BSGP">BSGP</a> by Kun
Zhou - with what they call &quot;intellectual property&quot;.</p>

<p>I guess  dr.Zhou believes  they are  going to make  him rich,  what he
might not grasp  is that his money comes  from <em>limiting the legitimate
liberties of users and developers who bought graphic devices and never
had the opportunity to use them as they want</em>.</p>

<p>With  a truly  open platform  for multiple  GPUs (cheaply  produced in
large numbers as components of consumer products), the computing speed
of hardware  can dramatically increase. Unfortunately  what is already
available  by  ATI and  NVIDIA  cannot  be  (yet?)  recycled  for  the
purpose.</p>

finish  his speech  on the  crisis  of the  Government, while  several
aggressions where having place in the Palazzo Viminale.</p>

<p>As a  result of  that episode the  second Prodi  government (moderated
left)  has fallen  and people  where  toasting with  champagne in  the
middle of  the Parliament, which is  not exactly what  you expect from
members of the government when their institution falls in crisis.</p>

<p>That's it:  in Italy  a coup  is done toasting  with champagne  in the
Parliament,  then the  &quot;nation&quot;  is taken  over  by a  filo-industrial
police  state  that can  be  easily defined  fascist  in  most of  its

ritual.</p>

<p>Many thanks  go to  anyone contributing to  this document, we  like to

to go in our same directions,  while it will be corrected and expanded
in the future with all the contributions we keep on receiving.</p>

cyber-crime, none of them is really aware of the damage they are doing
to humanity  by playing with  its fears and  freedoms. If it  keeps on
like that it's easy to guess  that we might be disconnected one day by

<p>Then  we'd better  settle some  plans  before that  happens: set  your
nuclear bunker online  :) ... well even without  a bomb-like event, it
might happen that ISP's go  for complete commercialisation as it seems
<a href="http://lab.dyne.org/EndOfInternet">some are already planning in Canada</a>.</p>

<p>So please <a href="http://www.i2p2.de/">i2p2</a> and <a href="http://netsukuku.freaknet.org">netsukuku</a> and more alternatives: no fooling around,
set  a  roadmap,  emergency  simulation tests  and  procedures.   It's

        <h2>ISEA aftermath</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">I've  spent  the last  week  and  a  half in  Singapore:  facilitating
discussion     for      the     <a href="http://singaporeagenda.wordpress.com/workgroup-3/">ASEF     mini-summit</a>      and     then
<a href="dynebolic_nomadic_system.pdf">presenting the dyne:bolic nomadic OS</a> at <a href="http://www.isea2008singapore.org/">ISEA2008</a> - and it was my first
time at ISEA, a conference that goes on since more than 10 years now.</p>

<p>I'll  note  down  my  experience,  as  a  &quot;<em>7th  generation  new  media
artist</em>&quot;...  my feelings are so far  <a href="http://www.boundaryobject.org/2008.07.01_arch.html#1217521235354">best resumed by Bronac</a> and by this
excellent <a href="http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0808/msg00026.html">report by Brogan Bunt</a>, while I still hope there will be some
more discussion around, so I'll just mention two more facts.</p>

<p>My written  contribution is  not even present  in the  ISEA catalogue,
even if  it was selected for  publication: <em>Mircosoft DOC  was the only
format accepted</em> (not pdf, rtf, nor anything else) and this excludes me
because of  my <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html">objection of  consciousness</a> to its use.   Actually this
issue is an <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/06/10/2018238">extremely important one</a> in <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/06/01/1912234">several countries</a> especially in
the <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/05/30/1942215">south of the World</a>, but is neglected by the ISEA organisation that
uses proprietary formats for all documents in the conference.</p>

<p>Another astonishing  thing was to  hear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Manovich">Lev Manovich</a> giving  a keynote
that was  basically advocating  data-mining in a  fancy format.   I am
horrified to  see that the media  art scene goes that  way (and that's
it, if you pay 20k SGD  to hear such theories) when it should actually
be  one of  the few  critical contexts  in respect  to  this worldwide
tendency to keep everyone under control.</p>

<p>Among  the few interesting  things printed  out I've  found a  list of
&quot;<em>Viridian Principles 2.0&quot;</em> at the <a href="http://www.luminousgreen.org/">Luminous Green</a> workshop mentioning as
one important <em>Moral Principle</em> prof.Manovich might want to acknowledge:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Every  design process  is incomplete  unless it  takes  into careful
consideration what could  be done with the product  by a dictatorial
megalomaniac  in command of  a national  economy, secret  police and
large army.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Schade</em>!  I never enjoy to be  polemical, but the need for criticism is
urgent here.</p>

<p class="quoted">NADA will seek to build  an Internet architecture that delivers data
from the edge  of the Internet using set  top boxes and Peer-to-Peer
technology, instead of  the network-centric architecture that stores
and delivers content from  data centers via Internet backbones. NADA
is proposing  a network of hundreds  of thousands of  set top boxes,
hugely popular in Europe, to be essentially split into two: one side
is  the user interface  side, the  other a  virtualised Peer-to-Peer
storage client  that stores and sends  media in the same  way a data
center would.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">I've matured a very critical opinion on W3C activity.</p>

<p>I actually  started with the  offer RealNetworks manager  Rob Lanphier
made  me in  2002 to  buy the  <a href="http://muse.dyne.org">MuSE</a> audio  streaming software  and all
dyne.org software  house, which  I promptly refused  as it  would have
meant  to close  all the  sources as  &quot;<em>Real Networks  doesn't supports
independent efforts</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>What this  has to do with W3C?   well at that time  Mr.Lanphier was on
the W3C  board for the  &quot;open&quot; protocol SMIL  - a board  that, despite
being proposing  a standard protocol, counted all  members coming from
<em>closed source companies</em>.</p>

<p>That made it clear to me that <em>W3C collaborators</em> not only were ignoring
open source  technologies, but <em>were  active in investing  for closing
the development of open source software competitors</em>.</p>

<p>Now  a  good  insight  in  W3C's  faults is  given  by  this  article,
mentioning we should <a href="http://pseudosavant.com/blog/2008/07/08/a-proprietary-web-blame-the-w3c/">blame W3C for proprietary web</a> developments.</p>

<p>It  would feel  much  better, being  an  European, to  not know  about
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/nmfunds#details9">public funds as  the WAI-AGE</a> paying off W3C  closed source agenda with
our tax money.</p>

<p>Anyway, i  got the scoop today  from <a href="http://jebba.blagblagblag.org/">Jeff</a>, something  called <a href="http://cspace.in/">CSpace</a> is
out  and it sounds  like a  good plan  for a  cross-platform framework
mainly based on python...</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">...to  provide  a connect(user,service)  primitive,  similar to  the
sockets API  connect(ip,port). Applications  built on top  of CSpace
can simply invoke connect(user,service) to establish a connection.</p>

<p>on my  list of software to  be tried, just besides <a href="http://i2p2.de/">i2p</a> and <a href="http://syndie.i2p2.de/">syndie</a>.</p>

heuristics of information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">A  research team  led  by  Prof. Hermann  Maurer,  chairman of  Graz
University's Institute  for Information Systems  and Computer Media,
argues that Google is turning  into a new version of George Orwell's
&quot;Big Brother&quot;  - creating unacceptable  monopolies in many  areas of
the worldwide web.</p>

<p>Not only  online, but  also in  real life: most  of my  hacker friends
received offers to be assimilated. And me too, in December 2007 <strong>I said
no to Google</strong>  asking me an interview for  a software engineer position
at  Google  Search in  Europe.   I  thought  that even  <strong>accepting  the
interview would have meant data-mining my brain</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Who owns Facebook?</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">A  recent  article  was  published   by  the  Guardian  UK  about  the
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jan/14/facebook">&quot;futurist&quot; philosopher and venture capital behind Facebook</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The  real face  behind Facebook  is the  40-year-old  Silicon Valley
venture capitalist and futurist philosopher Peter Thiel.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">A  philosophy graduate  from Stanford,  in 1998  he co-wrote  a book
called The Diversity Myth, which  is a detailed attack on liberalism
and  the  multiculturalist  ideology  that  dominated  Stanford.  He
claimed  that the &quot;multiculture&quot;  led to  a lessening  of individual
freedoms.  While a student  at Stanford,  Thiel founded  a rightwing
journal, still up  and running, called The Stanford  Review - motto:
Fiat   Lux  (&quot;Let   there  be   light&quot;).  Thiel   is  a   member  of
TheVanguard.Org,  an internet-based  neoconservative  pressure group
that was set up to  attack MoveOn.org, a liberal pressure group that
works on the web. Thiel calls himself &quot;way libertarian&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">There are only three board  members on Facebook, and they are Thiel,
Zuckerberg and  a third  investor called Jim  Breyer from  a venture
capital  firm  called  AccelPartners  [...]   who  put  $12.7m  into
Facebook in April  2005. On the board of such  US giants as Wal-Mart
and  Marvel Entertainment,  he  is  also a  former  chairman of  the
National Venture Capital  Association (NVCA).  [...] Facebook's most
recent round of funding was led by a company called Greylock Venture
Capital,  who put in  the sum  of $27.5m.  One of  Greylock's senior
partners is called Howard Cox,  another former chairman of the NVCA,
who  is also  on  the  board of  In-Q-Tel.  What's In-Q-Tel?   Well,
believe  it  or not  (and  check out  their  website),  this is  the
venture-capital wing of the CIA. [...] In-Q-Tel's first chairman was
Gilman  Louie,   who  served   on  the  board   of  the   NVCA  with
Breyer. Another  key figure in the  In-Q-Tel team is  Anita K Jones,
former  director of  defence  research and  engineering  for the  US
department  of defence,  and -  with Breyer  - board  member  of BBN
Technologies.&quot;</p>

        <h2>FOSS and Art, content and tools</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-text">
      <p class="first">I've been  writing <a href="http://coredump.buug.de/pipermail/spectre/2008-January/008956.html">a  long mail</a> on  the Spectre discussion  list about
freedom and licensing of tools  and art.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The FOSS  movement is about  software tools: as many  other creative
tools, the importance  to be free (as in speech, not  as in beer) is
related to the autonomy and  independence of productive use - access
to media production means - possibility to create local economies.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">It is a  captious error to relate the <em>social need</em>  of FOSS (and more
in general for an idealistic total freedom in reproducing production
means) to the <em>strategy</em> of  total freedom in content, especially when
freedom is  not a social  priority, but eventually a  viral strategy
for emerging statements.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Not  even   the  Free  Software  Foundation  enters   the  merit  of
distribution of art and cultural production, where a similar freedom
as  the  one  advocated  with  FOSS could  render  the  economy  not
sustainable anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">On the contrary, in case of  tools that are sensible to the people's
communication,  to the  expression of  their creativity  and  to the
circulation of culture, there is the need for a neutral, transparent
and modifiable framework of production shared by all.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">If you consider  the case that a graphic  designer using proprietary
software  might find  it  difficult to  show  and reproduce  her/his
creations, you understand why the need for FOSS is urgent.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">On the contrary, until just a few decades ago, it was much easier to
build  or borrow  a brush  and the  distribution of  a  painting was
mostly bound to logistical problems  and not licensing issues of the
canvas.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Unfortunately in the field  of cultural production nowadays there is
very  little public  support  for people  building  free and  shared
creative  infrastructures, while  there  is a  big  waste of  public
resources for  the statements of fewer  people affording proprietary
means for their cultural production: no wonder why the nature of the
project  opening  this discussion  is  antagonistic,  while it  also
sympathises with open source practices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Together with my contribution to the <a href="http://www.montevideo.nl/nl/nieuws/detail.php?id=158&amp;archief=ja&amp;showjaar=2005&amp;beginjaar=">Content in Context</a> publication it
might be worth to reformulate all this into a new <a href="http://jaromil.dyne.org/expirations.html">expiration</a>..</p>
