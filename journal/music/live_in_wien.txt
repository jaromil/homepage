This is the full, raw, uncutted recording of a stream we did for the observatori.02 festival in Valencia, Spain.

We've been performing for on our in the dyne.org lab in vienna, one of ours neighboors remembers it very well. 

 dindon = effetti e metodica rumoristica
 jaromil = voce e chitarra semiacustica
 quartzbubu = sassofono sapiente
 shezzan = djambe, congas, marimba etc.

until now, nobody of us ever found the time to cut this, trying to make i a bit shorter and saving the good parts in it, any help is appreciated.
