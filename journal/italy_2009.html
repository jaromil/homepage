<h1>Italy in 2009</h1>    
<h2>The Therapeutic State of Italy</h2>

<h3>26 December 2009</h3>

<p class="first">I'm spending  the last days of this  decade in Italy and  once again I
can't  resist to  write up  some reflections  and  impressions, mostly
digging into the large  quantity of press, parliamentary inquiries and
discussions, media carnage, strange  memories and half words whispered
on italic streets.</p>

<p>Just  some days  ago the  episode of  Massimo Tartaglia,  the  man who
targeted  the face  of prime  minister  Berlusconi using  a statue  of
Milano's  Cathedral as  projectile,  had a  huge  impact on  worldwide
media.</p>

<p>To understand what is happening,  the consequences of this media storm
is necessary  to keep our  considerations simple, our feet  on ground,
especially considering  the large quantity of elements  found.  Let me
first use an  anecdote, as recalling it helps a  lot in establishing a
track for the interpretation of what happened:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Milano, navigli, summer  of 2008, 3AM. Hanging at a  bar table for a
last drink with  a good old friend, congratulating  for his recently
started  PhD in  theology, dressed  decently for  the  occasion, his
British girlfriend looking  gorgeous.  Last exchanges, pubs closing,
cops  on the  street  controlling  no robbery  takes  place in  this
delicate  moment of the  night. I  turn around  talking to  the last
client besides us, mostly to hide  my envy look at my friend and his
girlfriend - let's blame the spirits and the late hour.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The last client doesn't takes any orders, doesn't smells of alcohol,
but  speaks southern  dialect which  makes us  closer.  My  hair are
freshly cut and  I must be sympathetic to him, so  after a few jokes
on our common southern heritage I  invite him for the last round and
he tells  me not, since  he is an  &quot;undercover&quot; agent, also  here to
watch over the pubs closing.  My comment: &quot;dangerous job!&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">He feels important and decides to  let loose. To get the best out of
the situation I'm  trying to look admired, as I'd  like to serve the
police and be such a hero. So the guy tells me he once did something
very dangerous:  he was the  bodyguard of Mr.  Berlusconi.   My eyes
wide open.  I  act surprised.  Inside me I wonder  if he is phishing
for some compromising comment.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">He smiles, I stay silent, he  blinks the eye, looking to me like I'd
be the  one making  him a favour,  then whispers &quot;...believe  me, if
someone would  have thrown  him a  stone while I  was in  service, I
would have dodged the blow and let it land on his face&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back  to   December  2009,  Berlusconi's   broken  nose  has   a  huge
significance  on screens  and  prints worldwide,  betraying that  well
studied brand of a powerful and successful man, like Mussolini with an
added media-aware smile, the same  premier who was recently smiling at
the G20 in pictures with Barack Obama, the 73 years old daddy gossiped
to practice fisting with his young escorts, now bleeding from his nose
in Mondovision.</p>

<p>Like in a spectacular rite of catharsis - but not just that.</p>

<p>Mr.  Tartaglia (his name literally translated in &quot;stutter&quot;) appears as
a town's fool hanging around the  Duomo of Milano: he has no political
affiliation,  no leaflets  were found  in his  pockets and  bag, which
besides the  statue of the  Cathedral contained just some  plastic and
metal scrap, a crucifix in chalk and a big piece of Quartz crystal.</p>

<p>Regime  commentators  react  to  the episode  quickly  and  massively:
&quot;Tartaglia is  a fool,&quot; they say  while his father states  that he has
shown signs of mental insanity since he was 20.  In this media picture
Tartaglia became a stuttering hero  for many facebook netizens who are
now   massively  identified   by  the   Italian  law   authorities  in
unprecedented quantities, while he is finally depicted by the Power as
transparent as  the crystal he carried:  he is absolved  by the regime
because he is just reflecting the &quot;unacceptable hatred&quot; circulating in
the Italian society against Mr. Berlusconi.</p>

<p>The episode reminds us when  USA president Ronald Reagan risked to die
in 1981,  at the beginning  of his mandate,  shot by the hand  of John
Hinckley, who  was then  ruled innocent for  reasons of  insanity (see
<a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTrials/hinckley/hinckleytrial.html">The Trial  of John  Hinckley by Douglas  Linder, 2002</a>). But  while the
outcome of Hinckley's trial raised  huge criticism, as many claimed it
is too  easy for  juries to return  &quot;not guilty&quot; verdicts  in insanity
cases, the dynamic  unfolding from this recent attempt  of a spaghetti
assassination is well different.</p>

<p>Also  in our  case, with  a huge  celebration of  Piety, the  guns are
turned away from Tartaglia; nevertheless  they stay armed and ready to
fire on  a new breed of  terrorists: the &quot;moral  responsibles&quot; of this
aggression,  the   so  called  &quot;media  terrorists&quot;.    The  blows  are
redirected against two political targets: state television journalists
Santoro  and Travaglio;  at the  same time  a larger  attack  is moved
against freedom  of speech on the  Internet, a political  target for a
State  whose ties  with Mafia  are documented  at  astonishing details
right in  these days - as  documented for instance  by daily newspaper
&quot;Il Fatto  Quotidiano&quot;, to which  also Travaglio contributes,  which a
few  days ago  published the  so called  &quot;hidden interview&quot;  made with
assassinated   magistrate  Paolo  Borsellino   by  Fabrizio   Calvi  e
Jean-Pierre Moscardo in 1992.</p>

<p>Arguably  this  atmosphere  of  compulsive aggression  refrains  on  a
variation of the well known  &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_of_tension%20">strategy of tension</a>&quot;, frequently adopted
in  Italy, signed by  <a href="http://ur1.ca/gjgz">ambiguous bomb  attacks</a> and  witch-hunts against
left-wing  extremism  which  immediately  preceded and  followed  this
episode.</p>

<p>Even from an orthodox point of  view it's reasonable to think that the
security  apparatus set  to defend  a  high state  official cannot  be
pierced  by a  town's fool  throwing a  souvenir statue  at  him. This
ridiculous situation  opens the discourse  to all kinds  of ridiculous
considerations, with the result of distorting it.</p>

<p>Discussing  esoteric   references  in  the   symbolical  communication
happening  between the  devices of  Power and  Glory can  be extremely
confusing,  while a dangerous  manipulation of  the &quot;common  sense&quot; of
most citizens is  in act - and the target  of this manipulation should
be the ultimate focus of our analysis.</p>

<p>After  all, Berlusconi's  bodyguards  were employees  (or most  likely
precarious  workers...)  of  a  private society:  they weren't  public
agents, a fact that precludes us from having a neutral account of what
really happened, as well poses  a theoretical dilemma on the nature of
the            Italian             State            and            the
<a href="http://antefatto.ilcannocchiale.it/glamware/blogs/blog.aspx?id_blog=96578&amp;id_blogdoc=2406865&amp;title=2406865">strained relationship between its current Government and its department of defence</a>
- a topic far beyond the scope of this text.</p>

<p>So, following with  our hypothesis, what would be  the target for this
media  manipulation?  It  seems  to be  attacking another  standing
point in  libertarian philosophy besides freedom of  speech: the right
to avoid being diagnosed for medical ailments and to reject treatment.</p>

<p>The  notion of  the &quot;Therapeutic  State&quot; is  defined  by psychiatrists
Franco Basaglia  and Thomas Szasz  in 1963 as a  collaboration between
the  government and  psychiatric  institutions resulting  in a  system
where  disapproved  thoughts,  emotions,  and  actions  are  repressed
(&quot;cured&quot;) through pseudo-medical interventions.</p>

<p>This   strategy  is  something   truly  convenient   for  Berlusconi's
government in its  current stage; but while in the  past Bush jr. lead
this  blow  in  a top-down  fashion  and  with  the alliance  of  drug
companies (see <a href="http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0411b.asp">&quot;Bush’s Brave New World&quot; by Sheldon Richman, 2005</a>), the
Italian media tycoon now uses his amplified channels of information to
affect the public perception on the concept of &quot;mental illness&quot;.</p>

<p>Berlusconi's controlled media, with  a massive coverage on the Italian
territory, depicts Tartaglia's mind as weak and potentially dangerous,
since it can be affected  by evil thoughts. While the de-subjectivated
body that follows evil thoughts is proclaimed innocent (a pious tribute
paid to Christianity) an educated exercise of criticism is regarded as
a source of degeneration, a seed of evil.</p>

<p>Not only all those that are psychologically weak can be manipulated by
the  means of  &quot;media terrorists&quot;  as Marco  Travaglio,  the judiciary
journalist appointed of being  moral responsible of what happened, but
the  open  media-sphere  in  its  entirety, with  social  networks  as
Facebook  on  the  first  line,  are  sources  of  &quot;moral  corruption&quot;
incentivating violence in the minds of fools.</p>

<p>Berlusconi's  self  declared  &quot;freedom's  party&quot;  political  coalition
formulated a  dangerous interpretation  on Tartaglia's case  which has
seen  no opposition in  the Italian  Parliament -  a place  where left
parties  seems   to  be  already   drugged  since  long.   It   is  an
interpretation which taints the popular perception of freedom: &quot;mental
illness&quot; is  an inherently incoherent  combination of a medical  and a
psychological concept,  but popular because it legitimises  the use of
psychiatric force to control and limit deviance from societal norms.</p>

<p>To conclude let us raise a  warning about the target of this maneuver:
it  might open  up a  new  front against  an important  reform of  the
Italian mental  health system,  the law number  180 made in  1978 that
established  the abolition  of the  mental health  facilities,  the so
called &quot;Manicomi&quot;.</p>

<p>At  last,  just while  writing  this  mail,  something more  happened:
Susanna Maiolo's  aggression to  the Pope of  the Catholic  Church, an
event that we  believe of different nature if  compared to Tartaglia's
case, still presents  analogies in the way the  aggressor is presented
and treated on  the media; but while it adds  urgency to our analysis,
ingenuous conspirationists  are satisfied by  depicting all this  as a
battle between super-heroes.</p>



<h2>ICT labour issues</h2>

<h3>11 November</h3>

<p class="first">The ICT  company Eutelia  Spa is occupied  by its employees  on strike
after  not  receiving  their  payments since  months.  Something  that
quickly  escalated  as  the  owner  of  the  company,  known  for  his
right-wing                                                 connections,
<a href="http://www.agenziami.it/articolo/4983/Ex+Eutelia+raid+dell+imprenditore+squadrista/">organised a &quot;private raid&quot; to force the striking employees out</a>. Nevertheless
the occupants resisted and are well determined to keep the place until
they'll have their rights respected.</p>




<h2>Italy after Berlusconi</h2>

<h3>11 September</h3>

<p class="first">It is still hard to imagine what  is awaiting Italy as the wave of the
crisis hits:  among other western neo-liberal  governments the Italian
Republic is the most de-stabilised by endemic corruption in its higher
spheres.</p>

<p>Today  a  fake-newspaper  screen-shot  joking  on  <a href="http://friendfeed-media.com/ad63fc1248c4aff3d6314d0de4c552fb6791029d">Berlusconi's  death</a>
spreads rapidly through the blog-sphere, an instant picture of popular
imagination, while  4 millions  euros go wasted  in a  <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/2009/09/sezioni/cronaca/armi-pericolose/armi-pericolose/armi-pericolose.html">weapon revision</a>
leaving  anti-mafia police  deprived  of fire-power,  right after  its
vertex criticised the Government for facilitating mafia's instances on
the territory.</p>

<p>A         new        documentary         is         released        by
<a href="http://docutrashfilm.noblogs.org/%20%20">indefatigable  south  Italian  activists</a>,  documenting  environmental
emergencies   and    criminal   speculations   on    trash   disposal:
<a href="http://vimeo.com/6000381">Una Montagna di Balle</a> is aired by the Neapolitan tele-street <a href="http://www.insutv.it">insu^tv</a>.</p>

<p>Grass-roots  protests are  erupting  in Abruzzo,  recently  hit by  an
earthquake generating  an incredible amount  of damage for  its scale:
the emergency  is now handled  by the State without  any participatory
process,  in collaboration with  some &quot;known&quot;  construction companies.
Meanwhile local communities are  organising in parallel for autonomous
reconstruction projects as <a href="http://eva.pescomaggiore.org">in Pescomaggiore</a>.</p>

<p>On the political  status of Italy I'm mostly  left without words these
days (quite unusual  if you know me), luckily  enough this analysis on
<a href="http://www.lospaziodellapolitica.com/2009/09/italy-after-berlusconi/">Italy after  Berlusconi</a> helps  describing the situation  with balance,
also expressing the urge for the mature political plan that is needed.</p>

<p>As  I've  written previously  in  this  journal:  Italy is  incubating
fascism.   This is  happening on  a &quot;semiotic&quot;  level, as  a narrative
shared among those who are  in power: &quot;<em>fascism is the autobiography of
the  Italian nation</em>&quot;  as Piero  Gobetti  already argued  in the  past.
Those  who right  after  the liberation  depicted  (and still  depict)
fascism just  as an episode  (as the invasion  of a Greek  island, how
Benedetto Croce  put it) were  dramatically wrong, probably  for their
own  convenience.  Fascism  in Italy  is not  just found  in  the life
records  of many  governors:  it  is the  way  different cultures  are
perceived, poor people are  treated, relationships are represented and
power  structures are  constructed, while  the  predominant celebrated
aesthetic is that  of &quot;Futurism&quot;: a rethoric made  to preserve its own
essence   as  intact,   unchanged,   unique,  arrogant,   magnificent,
centralised and intolerant.</p>

<p>How that could  happen? I'm not sure if that  really matters now, it's
being  too  late to  review  myopic  alliances  as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio">Gladio</a>,  chosen  by
occidental &quot;stay behind&quot; networks during the cold-war period in Italy.</p>

<p>The real  question now is how  to untie this spaghetti  mess. But well
this  is  enough for  now,  I'm  off  watching Tarantino's  Inglorious
Bastards, a good cathartic exercise I guess :)</p>



<h2>L'Aquila G8 preventive arrests</h2>

<h3>24 July</h3>

<p class="first">From  the website  of <a href="http://www.edu-factory.org">edu-factory</a>  a  call and  petition was  launched
against a  repressive operation coordinated  by the police  of Torino,
arresting people to &quot;prevent troubles&quot; at the G8 University Summit.</p>

<p>Police irrupted in the Social Center Askatasuna and in Padova at Radio
Sherwood's festival.   A total of 21  people have been  arrested: 6 in
Turin, 3 in Padua, 4 in Bologna, 1 in Naples and 1 in Milan.</p>

<p>Summed up with  other arrests I've heard of in  Abruzzo, the number of
people in jail is up to 38  and, as of today when the G8 is definitely
over, are still  held prisoners.  These arrests have  been operated on
behalf of anti-terrorist laws, without proving any suspicion about the
arrested, in fact criminalising them for their political views.</p>

<p>Here it follows the call for solidarity:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><strong>The perfect Wave cannot be arrested!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Call  in solidarity with  the students  arrested the  6th of  July in
Italy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">In the  night between the 5th and  the 6th of July,  21 students were
arrested in a sweeping police operation. They were charged with being
involved in the mobilization of the  19th of May in Turin against the
G8 University Summit.  On that day more than 10,000 undergraduate and
PhD students, as well as precarious researchers, took public voice in
a   huge  demonstration  to   express  another   time  -   after  the
mobilizations of last  fall - their opposition to  the dismantling of
the public university.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">These charges are not usually cause for preventive arrest, almost two
months after the  events. There is a clear  disproportion between the
supposed  charges  and the  use  of  a  heavy juridical  tool.   This
disproportion risks erasing democratic  principles, which must on the
contrary  be reaffirmed.  The  twenty-one arrested  - fifteen  are in
jail, six  under house arrest -  are young students,  almost all with
clean records.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We  express our  indignation at  the  disproportion of  this act  for
people who have simply demonstrated their dissent.  This has occurred
at  a time  when young  students and  researchers are  more  and more
worried about the lack of guarantees for the future and the uncertain
destiny of the public university.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We want to affirm  that we are on the side of  freedom of thought and
freedom to demonstrate dissent. We think that it is not acceptable to
manage every  protest as  a police problem.  We want to  affirm again
that  the university  is a  space of  freedom, confrontation  and the
production of knowledge.  Through these arrests it is not possible to
solve the contradictions and the problems of the public university.</p>

<h2>V-Strategy against G8</h2>

<h3>7 July</h3>

<p class="first">The Subcomandante Marcos (EZLN, Chiapas,  Mexico) said in a message to
the greek rebels on december 2008:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;Seven winds in  the lower calendars and geographies:  first wind, a
worthy and angry youth.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And today at the anti-G8 demonstration in Rome a big banner recited:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;V-Strategy against the G8 from Rome, looking at L'Aquila and at the
World&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.repubblica.it/2009/07/sezioni/esteri/g8-vertice-3/scontri-roma/scontri-roma.html">36 people were captured at the demonstration held in the Italian capital</a>,
for 10 of them the arrest  was confirmed, plus other 5 french citizens
were  arrested in  L'Aquila for  &quot;carrying sticks  in their  van&quot;, the
police declared.</p>

<p>In an article titled <a href="http://www.wombles.org.uk/article2009065527.php">V-Strategy,  waiting for the leaders of the Earth</a>
the  wombles.org.uk  website   publishes  today  the  following  text,
accompanying a call to protest against the G8 in L'Aquila:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">On  July 8th,  9th  and  10th the  president-master  of the  italian
government,  Silvio Berlusconi,  will host  the summit  of  the &quot;Big
Eight&quot; of the Planet.  The summit will take place in the fortress of
a State Police  Corps, in Coppito, a town close  to L'Aquila, a city
where people  and land are still  devasted by the  earthquake of the
6th of  April 2009.  The president  moved there the  summit from its
original destination: a  luxury liner off the sardinian  coast of La
Maddalena.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Due by the action of this arrogant governor, leader of a speculation
and  war system  responsible  for  the crisis,  is  taking shape  an
attempt to  validate again  the failed global  political governance.
The situationist of reaction,  Silvio Berlusconi, gives to the &quot;Big&quot;
of the Planet the opportunity to perform a show of &quot;sobriety&quot;, as he
called  it.  A  show he  would like  to be  appropriate to  face the
growing  ostilities and  rebellions rising  in every  corner  of the
World against the G8's decisions and dominance.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Behind the pitiful  cabaret - set up to take for  a walk the highest
political  offices  of  the  world,  along  the  tent-camps  of  the
earthquake's victims  - the summit will confirm  those decisions and
that dominance: to fund again the financial speculation; to save the
banks; to make labour more precarious and unstable; to reinforce the
security architecture; to implement cooperation among Nations in the
matter of repression; to keep  on with the no-border exploitation of
human  beings and natural  resources and  to build  up, at  the same
time,  new frontiers  of blood  and shame,  to  appease universities
through control and police.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The G8/G14/G21  is not just taking  place on a scene  devasted by an
earthquake,  whose  consequences  are  worsened by  speculation  and
social injustice,  but it  will be  held in the  middle of  a global
crisis,  in  a  period  of  riots against  oppressions  bursting  at
different latitudes. From the Argentinazo  to the revolt in El Alto,
Bolivia;  from the  Appo, in  Oaxaca, Mexico,  to the  resistance of
indigenous people  in Peruvian Amazonia; from the  rebellions in the
french banlieues to those of  migrant people against the lagers they
live  in, and  against  the  deportation systems  that  work in  the
buttres of  European Union -  as in Ceuta, Melilla,  Peloponnese and
Lampedusa;  from the  recent riots  in  Greece after  the murder  of
Alexandros Grigoropoulos -  16 years old, shot dead  by the police -
to the protests against the G20  in London - where Ian Tomlinson was
murdered by the police too - until the night of the riots in Berlin,
on the first of May, and the Nato meeting in Strasbourg.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The July  appointment has  been preceded in  Italy by a  sequence of
campaigns, protests and marches addressed to the highest ministerial
offices and to the lobbies that organized the G8. As in the cases of
the summits on Agriculture and Environment; of the meeting organized
by the chancellors in Torino -  ended with a clash between the march
of the  students and the  repressive police; of the  encounter among
the  Ministers of  Economy in  Rome, on  March 28th,  welcomed  by a
demonstration of students, unions  and flex workers that succeded in
breaking the prohibition to access to the center of the city; of the
actions  on May  29th and  30th in  Rome: the  one against  Oim, the
symbolic  occupation  of churches,  the  contacts  with the  migrant
people inside the CIE (centers of identification and deportation for
immigrants)   at    Ponte   Galeria,   and    the   antiracist   and
antisecuritarian march that  went all over the streets  of the city,
in line with the march in Milan a week before.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">On  the first  of June  a national  meeting in  L'Aquila  launched a
call-out  for realizing an  &quot;extended mobilization&quot;  in the  name of
&quot;radicality&quot; against the  G8. On June 21st, a  following meeting drew
up  a calendar.  Into this  frame,  the No-G8  network of  Rome -  a
convergence of different movements of social struggle that organized
the March and May actions reported above - proposes a &quot;Welcoming Day
for  the  Mighty   of  the  Planet&quot;  on  July   the  7th,  when  the
international deputations will pass through the italian capital.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Moreover,  the No-G8  network proposes  to  practice a  &quot;Map of  the
crisis&quot;, through actions  carried out by affinity groups.  A &quot;Map of
the crisis&quot; based  on the one sperimented in  London during the G20:
decentralized  actions in different  cities during  the days  of the
summit - in  Italy, in Europe and in the  countries belonging to the
&quot;Club of the Mighty&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We, social  activists, natives and migrants,  flex workers, builders
of independent  ways of life,  jealous of our sincere  and convinced
political independence, anti-capitalists and antifascists as much as
anti-authoritarians   and   anti-militaristics,   anti-racists   and
anti-sexists, support the final demonstration in L'Aquila.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">In the meantime, we intend  to realize during the &quot;Welcoming Day&quot; on
July the  7th, a block of the  traffic and of the  mobility that, by
combining  creative  and smartly  radical  practices, addresses  our
worthy rage to obstruct the functionality of the celebrations of the
Mighty of  the Planet and of their  bankruptcy.  Cooperation between
different subjects  scares the Crisis  rulers, and so we  believe in
this interaction as fundamental.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We propose  the same  to all the  no-border networks,  movements and
individuals that want to join us. We are going to receive you at the
best of our possibilities, through the resources and the initiatives
of  the movement,  in the  frame of  the local  features and  of the
methods shared by the unitary mobilization in Rome.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We propose again, to  all the networks, groups, movements, activists
living in the big cities of the  &quot;Club of Mighty&quot; to share a &quot;Map of
the crisis&quot;, as much as possible open and global, and to practice it
actively, in a reciprocal communication, during the following days.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We propose to  make converge actions in the  guiding lines of growth
and continuity, of  a protest movement to develop  during the months
to come, through the public denunciation and the social siege:</p>
</blockquote>


<ul>
<li>of  the  principal  responsibles  for  the  crisis  and  for  the
subtraction of income, freedom and rights.</li>

<li>of the structures belonging to the security architecture.</li>

<li>of  the principal responsibles for precarious  labour, for firing,
for death on the job.</li>

<li>of  the centers responsible  for the distruction of  resources and
life on the planet.</li>

<li>of  the  centers  responsibles  for the  aggression  against  the
material conditions of life.</li>

<li>of the centers responsibles for the expropriation of social wealth
and knowledge.</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">With  these suggestions  and  purposes,  we are  open  to an  active
political cooperation  and to  a connection with  alternative social
practices. From the July days of the meeting and on.</p>

<h2>Italy incubating fascism</h2>

<h3>15 June</h3>

<p class="first">It can only  be with condescending myopia that we  look at the Italian
situation pretending nothing really  is happening: the reality is hard
to digest, but Italy is incubating fascism.</p>

<p>Fascism in  the most literal form  ever since the  liberation in 1945,
let  the definition given  in <a href="http://openlibrary.org/b/OL4206848M/Fascismus">Der  Fascismus</a> by  Ignazio Silone  be an
historical reference of it.  This is not just a light word: fascism is
declared outlaw in the constitution of most European states, but right
now neglecting its existence for  the sake of a Government's integrity
might unfold even more tragedies in a close future.</p>

<p>The signals are  clear, evidences are collected at  a worrying rate by
<a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/italy">Amnesty  International</a>:  racist  aggressions and  intolerance  towards
migrants  are  denounced in  the  <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/2009/05/sezioni/esteri/amnesty-rapporto-2009/amnesty-rapporto-2009/amnesty-rapporto-2009.html">AI  report  for 2009</a>,  international
obligations to human rights are breached at governmental policy level.</p>

<p>OTOH it is  nowadays a clear benefit for Italian  citizens to be aloud
to move  in Europe: a  growing number of italian  &quot;political refugees&quot;
are approaching  neighbour states, trying to free  themselves from the
non-sense of a prolonged state crisis.</p>

<p>Italy is  a founding state of  Europe, thanks to  inspiring minds like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altiero_Spinelli">Altiero Spinelli</a> or <a href="http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/ip/mazzini.htm">Giuseppe Mazzini</a>, prisoners of fascism in the WWII
or   earlier  dissidents  exiled   by  non-secular   institutions  and
monarchies.  While   we  confront  the  present   situation  with  the
constitutional  principles  of the  Italian  state, our  Mediterranean
nation is profiling a sad paradox.</p>

<p>Increasing racist aggressions to ethnical minorities</a> are configuring a
theatre of conflict  characterized by well recognisable nazi-socialist
tints,   at   least   that's    what   <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/2006/05/gallerie/politica/divise-guardia/1.html">the   uniforms</a>   of   the   new
<a href="http://it.peacereporter.net/articolo/16046/Arrivano+le+ronde+nere">Guardia Nazionale Italiana</a> suggest.</p>

<p>The GNI is a controversial initiative about civilians in para-military
uniforms  patrolling  cities  to  fight criminality,  an  organisation
publicly  affiliated to extreme  right-wing groups  that sets  its own
goal  in &quot;promoting  and divulging  the Italian  story,  languages and
traditions, with particular reference to the Roman Empire&quot;.</p>

<p>A senior prosecutor  in Milano, <a href="http://www.statewatch.org/cia/documents/spataro-CV-1febr-2006.pdf">Armando Spataro</a> (who  has usually been
engaged against  &quot;left wing extremism&quot;) has  opened the investigations
on  possible  &quot;apology  of  fascism&quot;  for the  GNI,  right  after  the
organisation was presented in  Milano, its existence being legitimated
by new decrees on security (<em>DDL  sicurezza</em>) soon to be approved by the
Parliament.   The decrees  also  set several  thousands immigrants  in
Italy as &quot;illegal  people&quot; and almost exempts them  from civil status:
denial of  schooling, health  care etc.  etc.   which renders  them as
perfect urban target of the GNI patrolling activities.</p>

<p>What did catch  most of my attention as  a succulent semiotic artifact
disclosing  the imaginary  of  rising populist  xenophobe rhetoric  in
Europe  is the  symbol  of the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sun_(occult_symbol)">Black  Sun</a> and  its supposedly  occult
origins, adopted on the arm-band of the GNI uniforms.</p>

<p>This possible variation of the  swastika fibula is found in the marble
mosaic decorating the Obergruppenführersaal of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wewelsburg">Wewelsburg Castle</a> a
<a href="http://www.philipcoppens.com/wewelsburg.html">former nazi  concentration camp  and SS headquarter</a>.   A topos  of the
Teutonic sovereign through centuries, even during the 17th century the
castle  played a  key role  in the  witchcraft trials  sweeping across
Europe, presided  by the Catholic Prince Bishops:  local women accused
of witchcraft were held  in Wewelsburg's dungeons and confessions were
extracted under torture in an adjoining &quot;courtroom&quot;.</p>

<p>Looking deep into GNI's texts, an additional reference they use is the
reference  to  the  Hindu myth  of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga">Kali  Yuga</a>,  a potential  link  to
religious fundamentalism  in India, believing  that human civilization
degenerated spiritually in  a current &quot;Dark Age&quot;.  The  &quot;Kali&quot; of Kali
Yuga  is not  be confused  with the  goddess Kali,  but refers  to the
daemon  Kali, a  symbol for  strife, discord,  quarrel  or contention.
Following the Kali  Yuga interpretation, sin in our  age will increase
exponentially, virtue will fade and  cease to flourish and rulers will
become  unreasonable;  governments will  levy  taxes  unfairly and  no
longer  see it as  their duty  to promote  spirituality or  to protect
their subjects: they will become a danger to the world.</p>

<p>The &quot;occultist&quot; memes of the nationalist xenophobic movements in Italy
deal with  delusional feelings, a moralist  and conservative political
analysis as well an heritage of hatred against those who are perceived
as responsible  for the  demonized cultural decay:  homosexuals, gypsy
nomads, bohemiens, libertines and  of course migrants, corrupting with
their  cultural luggage (and  lower life  standard, by  necessity) the
idea of an Italian pure and &quot;decent&quot; civilization.</p>

<p>Digging  back into  ancient Roman  history,  we could  argue that  the
choice for a model that is more familiar to Italians could have fallen
over the historical  figure of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Elder">Marcus Porcius Cato</a>,  also known as The
Censor (<em>O  tempora!  o mores!</em>).   But the mythopoeic operation  of GSI
(and the MSI &quot;political&quot; party behind it) is arguably very limited: it
recycles WWII myths  allegedly referring to a castle  which, back in 9
AD, witnessed  the Battle  of the Teutoburg,  when Germanic  tribes in
alliance ambushed and destroyed three Roman legions, setting along the
Rhine  river  an historical  boundary  between  the  German and  Roman
Empires.</p>

<p>Most probably  the &quot;occultist&quot;  attribute of the  Black Sun is  just a
convenient alibi  in the rushed choice of  a coat of arms  that can at
the  same time  be familiar  to  European neo-nazi  movements as  well
presentable to  the scrutiny  of most people  who won't  recognise its
origins.</p>

<p>To conclude and back to present day we are left with a serious warning
by    former     foreign    affair    minister     Massimo    D'Alema,
<a href="http://www.repubblica.it/2009/03/sezioni/politica/berlusconi-varie/berlusconi-d-alema/berlusconi-d-alema.html">warning  Italy  about possible  upcoming  shocks</a>:  just  a day  before
Berlusconi pays  his first  visit to the  White House,  declaring that
he'll be <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/2009/03/sezioni/politica/berlusconi-varie/berlusconi-battuta/berlusconi-battuta.html">good looking  and with a proper tan</a> he is  fit to meet Barack
Obama  today  at  21  CET  to  discuss  over  Fiat-Chrysler,  European
relationships with north  Africa and of course the  upcoming G8 summit
to be held in Abruzzo.</p>




<h2>ICT disaster recovery</h2>

<h3>24 May</h3>

<p class="first">At  the  <a href="http://www.hackerspace.net/">Hackerspace</a>  festival  in  Paris  we  hosted  a  round  table
discussion on &quot;<em>ICT disaster recovery</em>&quot;  where hackers of the local (and
historical,  since BBS  times) <a href="http://www.olografix.org">Metro  Olografix</a>  telematic association
will  intervene,  giving an  overview  of  what  happened and  open  a
discussion on  the role of communication infrastructures  in zones hit
by disasters.</p>

<p>We know that many of the  hackers at the festival have good experience
of strategic development in  extreme conditions and disaster zones. We
want  to   draft  a  document  containing  a   practical  analysis  of
state-of-the-art technologies  and strategies that can  be deployed to
re-consolidate an efficient ICT infrastructure in Abruzzo.</p>




<h2>Saviano on migrants</h2>

<h3>15 May</h3>

<p class="first">Roberto Saviano is  the author of the book  &quot;Gomorra&quot; about Neapolitan
mafia:  he  became  a   declared  target  of  south  Italian  criminal
organisations as his writings revealed much of the people and dynamics
behind the phenomenon of Camorra.</p>

<p>On another topic, a few days ago Saviano published an article worth to
read, titled <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/2009/05/sezioni/cronaca/immigrati-7/saviano-coraggio/saviano-coraggio.html%20%20">the forgotten courage</a>, reminding Italians  they also are
migrants -  nowadays even more  than usual -  living the hard  life of
migrants as well.</p>

<p>The  focus  of Saviano  is  on  the killing  of  6  young Africans  in
Castelvolturno, 19 September 2008, and  on the perception of it within
civil  society, last but  not least  <a href="http://m2m.streamtime.org/index.php/2009/migrants-demo-in-napoli/">the recent  demonstration</a> (mostly
participated by African communities) to commemorate the tragedy.</p>

<p>Being informative and offering good insights, the article is concluded
with a  fresh quote of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altiero_Spinelli">Altiero Spinelli</a>, a relevant  political figure
for Europe (the  main building of the European  Parliament in Brussels
is named after him) but still not well known as it deserves.</p>

<p>During  10 years  of  imprisonment  by the  fascist  regime in  Italy,
Spinelli   wrote  the  so   called  &quot;Ventotene   Manifesto&quot;,  entitled
<a href="http://www.federalunion.org.uk/archives/ventotene.shtml">Towards a  Free and United Europe</a>  - a reading that  I warmly suggest,
containing critical  reflections on the  role of migration  in Europe,
clearly in contrast with the recent development of current policies.</p>

<p>Along  the   lines  lied  by   Saviano's  article,  let   me  remember
<a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo_Dierickx">Ludo Dierickx</a>, who recently passed away  on April 8 this year: a dutch
activist who  has progressed on Spinelli's  thoughts.</p>



<h2>Fortress Europe</h2>

<h3>14 May</h3>

<p class="first">A  racist epithet  on an  Italian daily  newspaper recently  moved the
attention  of the  Japanese  Embassy,  to the  point  they released  a
<a href="http://www.it.emb-japan.go.jp/italiano/comunicati%20stampa/Dini.htm">public  complaint</a> addressed  to  the director  of  Il Giornale,  which
happens to be the closest tabloid to Berlusconi's &quot;<em>editorial group</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>Not-so-funny stories  from the <em>feudal media landscape  of Italy</em>, still
just a burst  of steam from a bigger pot  under strong pressure.  Just
recently
<a href="http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Italia/2009/05/berlusconi-no-italia-multietnica.shtml">Berlusconi declared  that &quot;his idea  of Italy is  not multi-ethnical&quot;</a>;
the major of Rome corrected him on TV: &quot;<em>what he really wanted to say -
our idea - is that Italy should not be multi-cultural</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>Ah ah! thanks mr.Alemanno, we just thought he was talking about DNA.</p>

<p>And it's not just spaghetti-politics, there are more connections being
cut.  So far in  European countries  migrants are  not just  coming to
work, but can also study...   until next year, when <em>Fortress Europe</em> is
closing its  secular educational institutions to  students coming from
the  outside, as the  tuition to  be paid  by non-EU  students becomes
unaffordable for the most, while existing subsidies are cut.</p>

<p>And the financial crisis is not even finished, yet.</p>
