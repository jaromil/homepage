\placefigure[][]{}{\externalfigure[images/floating_gnu.jpg]}

Started  in 1984 by  Richard Stallman,  with help  by Eben  Moglen and
others, drafting  the GNU General  Public License, granting  users the
rights to:

\item Run for any purpose
\item Study and adapt
\item Redistribute
\item Distribute modifications

\Topic {Dyne.org network}

\placefigure[][]{}{\externalfigure[images/dyne-mid.png]}

Started  in  2000 publishing  {\em low-consumption}  software creations  for
broadcasting and freedom of speech, granting users with the rights to:

\startitemize
\item Promote the idea and practice of open source knowledge sharing
\item Open the participation to on-line and on-site communities
\item Foster employment of FOSS in artistic creation
\item Support FOSS development, also when non-profitable

\Topic {The Lies of ``Free'' Market}

The {\bf Laws  of Free-Trade} dictate that  when you exchange  money for the
purchase  of  any item,  that  item  belongs  to you  without  strings
attached.

\placefigure[][]{}{\externalfigure[images/iphone.jpg]}

{\bf Mobile  communication  objects sold  worldwide  are restricted}.   Such
mobile  communication devices constitute  nowadays the  widest network
around the globe, mostly used by citizens for private communications.


\Topic {The Industrial Involution of Art}

\startitemize
\item {\bf Who  owns  what}?   In  digitally  produced  contemporary  art  the
tool-makers (and not the artists!)  own the rights to reproduce the
artworks.
\item {\bf Uniformed design}.   In a  globally connected  world  uniformity is
marketed  better than  variety  (simplifying cognitive  processes):
uncommon ground is seen as  a threat, massive outreach is forced by
flattening perception.
\item {\bf Mis-creative  industries}.  Improvised  social  forms built  around
close-knit  networks and  non-conventional human  relationships are
substituted by  the absorption  of human emotion  into bureaucratic
channels:  the emergence  of a  social coolness,  an  efficiency of
feeling. \footnote{For an extensive  analysis on the topic see "The  Next Idea of the
Artist" essay  by Rana Dasgupta (2008) published  on the catalogue
of the Liverpool Biennial}
\item {\bf Futurist  corpses}.   Ideology  and advertising  have  exalted  the
permanent mobilisation  of the  productive and nervous  energies of
humankind towards profit and war. \footnote{The Post-Futurist Manifesto. Franco Berardi, February 2009}

\Topic {Piracy vs Neo-Colonialism}

\startquotation
Piracy does not simply  exist because there are bloody-minded people
who don't  care for the  rules and laws  of the civilised  world. It
tends to  emerge whenever  there is a  hegemonic power  that asserts
itself by  establishing a  trade monopoly. ({\em Armin Medosh})
\stopquotation

\placefigure[][]{}{\externalfigure[images/kop.png]}

\startquotation
During the first decades of America's existence as a nation, private
citizens,   voluntary   associations,   and   government   officials
encouraged the smuggling of  European inventions and artisans to the
New World.  These actions  openly violated the intellectual property
regimes  of  European  nations. ({\em Doron Ben-Altar})
\stopquotation


\Topic {Creativity is an Hybrid}

The Net as Artwork\footnote{The Net as Artwork, Tatiana Bazzichelli, Costa e Nolan (it, 2006), Digital Aesthetics Research Center, Aarhus University (en, 2008)}:

\placefigure[][]{}{\externalfigure[images/networkingart.jpg]}

\startitemize
\item {\bf Activist}: social awareness
\item {\bf Artist}: lyrical expression
\item {\bf Hacker}: technical autonomy
\stopitemize

Art  production  focuses on  low-tech,  critical  thinking, re-use  of
existing   infrastructures,    circumventing   limitations,   remixing
identities,  trespassing borders  and breaking  open the  box\footnote{Smash the Surface / Break Open the Box / Disrupt the Code, Eric Kluitenberg, ProContra / CFront (2000)}  in a
scenario of global, horizontal\footnote{Peer-2-Peer} sharing of ideas and practices.

\Topic {The Rise of new Values}

\startitemize
\item {\bf Refuse Scarcity}. Abundance is not our enemy, it is our friend.

\item {\bf Refuse   the  Big  Success},   the  Big  Audience,  the   Big  Mass
Media. Connect  specific communities with  low-cost and low-latency
distribution

\item {\bf Refuse the Broadcast  Quality}. Embrace modesty, publish unfinished,
involve  people,  work   enthusiastically  with  what's  available.
Follow the vector of quality, don't pursue its mirage.

\item {\bf Recycle!} modular architectures, generic infrastuctures.

\item RE-USE! {\bf BRICO BRICO}
\stopitemize
