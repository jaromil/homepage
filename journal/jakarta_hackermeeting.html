<p>Meeting  in TIM at  18:00, present  <a href="http://jaromil.dyne.org">Jaromil</a>, <a href="http://dynebolic.org">Bono</a>,  <a href="http://www.tmplab.org/">Philippe Langlois</a>;
later joining Kugutsumen, <a href="http://jim.giovedi.com">Jim Geovedi</a>.</p>

<p>This account of the discussion was written by Jaromil and Philippe.</p>

<h2><a name="sec1" id="sec1"></a>
Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">A small introduction of the meeting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>J: We're  here for  a roundup  of initiatives, to  draw a  panorama of
things happening this  year in Indonesia, as it seems  there is a very
hacktive scene  coming up and lots  of things being  organized. We are
all  involved in similar  projects that  can be  well related  to each
other, this  meeting aims to  update all of  us and share  ideas about
what we are doing and what we are going to do.</p>

<p>PL: Is there a network gathering all FOSS and free network efforts in
Indonesia?</p>

<p>B: not really, there are groups forming as Penguin Merah for instance</p>


<h2><a name="sec2" id="sec2"></a>
Infrastructure</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Discussion starts about network infrastructure present in Indonesia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>PL: Is the spectrum free?</p>

<p>B: yes, 2.4Ghz is free to be used unlicensed</p>

<p>PL: for inspirations have a look at <a href="http://start.freifunk.net/">freifunk</a>...</p>

<p>J: ...and <a href="http://www.funkfeuer.at/">funkfeuer</a>. A reference documentation on building antennas is
published on <a href="http://lab.dyne.org/AntennaDIY">bricolabs</a>.</p>

<p>PL: in France we have 20Mbit/s connection over ADSL for 30EU per month
(~400k IDR):  this made wireless  communities not so  important. Still
interesting  to  ack   that  first  operator  to  do   that  was  very
aggressively challenging the law and France Telecom monopoly.</p>

<p>B: Indonesian Telecom shares are quite much owned by Singapore</p>

<p>J: ID put the first asian satellite in the sky... and is now mostly
owned by SG</p>

<p>B: at present in ID the network infrastructure available is:</p>

<ul>
<li>satellite clear channel SCPC (Single Channel Per Carrier) (Palapa)</li>
<li>satellite IP based network</li>
<li>HDSL (over copper wire)</li>
<li>DVB over satellite</li>
<li>radio wifi links on 2.4Ghz</li>
<li>5.8Ghz licensed frequencies for the backbone</li>
<li>optical fibers (for limited areas)</li>
</ul>

<p>J: an important infrastructure are  also Warnet points.  Their role in
development of open cultural discourse in Indonesia was crucial in the
past 10 years. Interesting to note that while Wartel is a governmental
initiative, Warnet is a  grassroot community of small businesses. More
<a href="documents/Internet_in_Indonesia_MerlynaLim2004.pdf">details can be found in a publication</a> printed by <em>Antropologi Indonesia
Journal</em> in 2004.</p>


<h2><a name="sec3" id="sec3"></a>
A friend of Philippe arrives</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>Kugutsumen</em> joins us</p>
</blockquote>

<p>K: Hi all.   I'm originally from France, i  work in security assessment
and pentest for various companies, Jim Giovedi is my friend.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>J, PL and K rapidly find out they share several hacker acquaintances</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>K: I'm based in Jakarta now since several years...</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>discussion about Jakarta, Jogja and Bali</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>PL: i want to visit Jogja! next time, i'm back in April</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>slow discussion, we order food</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>PL: Jim will come later, he is a similar figure as me, artist/techie -
art and tech are closer eh.</p>


<h2><a name="sec4" id="sec4"></a>
Gaming culture</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Gaming is the most widespread social phenomenons in technology, also
and especially in Asia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>J: what is the role of games in /tmp/lab?</p>

<p>PL: we don't play any corporate  produced games, we have our own, like
hacking water counters can be challenging :)</p>

<p>K: games rapidly  gain more importance as they  mix with reality, they
are more and more a way to interact for people</p>

<p>PL: what  i don't  like is that  corporate designed  interaction steps
into  social environments,  as  social becomes  also  private this  is
dangerous. Second  Life can  be fascinating but  on a  second analysis
very scary. Coding games can be amazing in bringing people together..</p>

<p>J: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=brainfuck">brainfuck</a>? :)</p>

<p>PL:  yes.   also  crazy  games,  simple shell  games  terminal  based,
designing   new  weird   protocols...    in  /tmp/lab   we  have   the
<a href="http://www.onedayblast.org">one  day blast</a>: for  one day,  anybody can  come to  the lab,  put his
laptop on a desk, connect to the net and code all day. People show up,
start new  projects, join projects  started earlier that day,  and all
code, create, design,  cut video etc... At the end  of the day, people
just show what they did in one day and everybody discuss the projects,
their      use,      the     orientation.</p>

<p>J: striking resemblance  with what in the freaknet  poetry hacklab has
called <a href="http://poetry.freaknet.org/troppocaffepococervello/">Troppo caffe', Poco cervello</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="sec5" id="sec5"></a>
Hacking spaces</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">About physical spaces where we can hack and develop ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>PL: what about your space in Amsterdam?</p>

<p>J: <a href="http://www.scii.nl">ASCII</a> was a kind of internet  cafe, a toko on da street, but is now
atomized in a network of places in  A'dam. so now my place is a living
space/hacklab,  we hack  in our  rooms, mix  living space  and hacking
space.</p>

<p>PL: very similar to /tmp/lab</p>

<p>K: problems with behaviours?</p>

<p>PL: no  probs. /tmp/lab is  also a living  space for two of  us, usual
episodes, always solvable, of giving people some responsibility</p>

<p>K: i had bad experiences....</p>

<p>J: nothing  that cannot  be kept under  control and  loosely regulated
with some agreed rules that make sense to everyone.</p>

<p>PL: an important  thing in developing such spaces  is concentrating on
the infrastructure  rather than specific projects, as  outlined in the
<a href="documents/Hacker-Space-Design-Patterns.pdf">Hacker Space Design Patterns</a> presentation made by <a href="http://www.ccc.de">CCC</a> in 2007.</p>


<h2><a name="sec6" id="sec6"></a>
What hackers use</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">A few impressions on what OS platform most hackers use</p>
</blockquote>

<p>B: and what hackers like most as a OS?</p>

<p>PL: definitely gnu/linux. what about ID?</p>

<p>B: here there are many geeks/hackers, mostly in campus....</p>

<p>J: but what they do?</p>

<p>B: ... nasty things, viruses and such...</p>

<p>PL: ... good old days.</p>

<p>J: LOL</p>


<h2><a name="sec7" id="sec7"></a>
Migrations to GNU/Linux</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Like Exodus, an important step for freedom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>B: very often here if you use windows. actually most people spend all
their time scanning for viruses and loosing your data!</p>

<p>K: one  interesting phenomenon is that  m$ is cracking  down on piracy
everywhere, and here too, where piracy is widespread.  the good effect
of this is  that everyone switches to gnu/linux  then.  In our company
we even banned m$ office for cost/efficiency reasons, most people uses
osx or gnu/linux, only two people are left on win now.</p>

<p>PL: my problem on OSX is that openoffice is too slow...</p>

<p>J: what about <a href="http://www.neooffice.org/">neooffice</a>?</p>

<p>PL: neooffice too. slow :|</p>

<p>B:  in my  company  we  had problems  with  compatibility of  systems,
accessing databases,  security and network traffic, this  was a hassle
all the time. When i met J  last month and i decided to switch to d:b:
that was  done in  one day,  all the office  is now  running d:b  as a
desktop :)  no problems  at all, engineers  are already  mastering the
platform  and we  even  printed our  own  CDs.  Only  problem left  is
compatibility for two office tasks: presentations (M$ PowerPoint files
are not fully supported by  OpenOffice) and databases access (again M$
files are not well compatible for OpenOffice).</p>

<p>J: B is  mentioning the biggest success story  i had experienced about
d:b in my  life. B works in a  professional engineering environment, i
am astonished to see how d:b can  be useful for them.. and in all that
i had to do nothing.</p>

<p>B: by now we are saving a lot of money for software licenses.</p>


<h2><a name="sec8" id="sec8"></a>
Education</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">We all  know the quality of  academies is degrading, but  some of us
are optimistic and all of us are doing something to make it better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>K: one big prob.  not only in  ID, but in USA, is what people learn at
school, young people are told  how to use commercial programs, Oracle,
VB and  such..  and they don't  even know algorithms.  when we recruit
now we specify &quot;no VB&quot; and we get some better result.</p>

<p>PL:  for me  this  is an  old problem,  this  is the  old paradigm  of
schools, is gone.</p>

<p>K: you  say that because  your academic background is  optimal.... but
the problem is still there.</p>

<p>PL:  yea, ok.  anyway.   now there  is agile  development, incremental
education, open courseware (from  MIT), everything is different, those
days are gone.</p>

<p>K: When i look to find programmers to work for me the main problem, in
Indonesia or  France, is that they  don't have passion.  there is very
few people with passion to work with computers.</p>

<p>PL:  this is  a distorted  view.   for sure  there is  a pyramid,  for
security, protocol engineering, hard stuff like that, when you mention
passion you are referring to the  top of the pyramid, where there will
be  surely less people.   the top  of the  pyramid carries an holistic
vision, an organic  higher vision, actually these are  the people able
to mix interests and abilities.  below them there is the industry, the
workers, and that is also necessary to be there, they are important as
well.</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>PL &amp; K debating hard on the issue, then food arrives: makan!</em></p>
</blockquote>


<h2><a name="sec9" id="sec9"></a>
What we'll never transcribe</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">J, PL  and K share lots  of european hackers stories  that cannot be
fully  transcribed.    Among  the  topics   was  the  founder   of  of
<a href="http://zone-h.org">http://zone-h.org</a>  who was  arrested  in Italy  some  time ago,  after
coming back  from Jakarta the  week before (hopefully won't  happen to
us!), as  well the <a href="http://www.quintessenz.at/harkank/Death_at_the_surveillance_interface/Telecom_Italia_affair/">italian telecom  scandal</a>.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Back to  Indonesia, where security  hacking is also  quite widespread,
<a href="documents/BCS2006-Purbo.pdf">Onno  Purbo has held  a brilliant  presentation</a> where  he demonstrates
with  statistical analysis  how the  hacker community  is  growing and
especially how it grows more after every new police bust.</p>


<h2><a name="sec10" id="sec10"></a>
Miscommunication issues</h2>

<p class="first">Where we discuss  the problems of loose collectives  or networks where
theoretically anyone can speak in the name of everyone, or not.</p>

<p>PL: What  about mis-communication and fake information  about your lab
and activity? sometimes people really have to come to us to understand
what we do, most information  circulating is very misleading.  or like
gossip mailinglists... a counter-hitting Bolkenstein project.</p>

<p>J: at the  freaknet we had press releases  to negate misleading myths,
plus  rely on full  information on  online websites.  About Amsterdam,
that is  like a  little town,  everyone knows about  each other,  so i
prefer to hide nothing and seek open dialog with anyone, that works.</p>


<h2><a name="sec11" id="sec11"></a>
Hacking birds</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Hacks done on the Indonesian satellite &quot;Palapa&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>K. shows us a video documentary on &quot;hacking a bird in the sky&quot; done in
Bandung: live hacking of VSAT  satellite systems. Will upload and link
here where more bandwidth is available.</p>

<p>B: hacked only on receive?</p>

<p>K: yes.   fact is that  ATM transactions here  go in clear  channel to
lower latency...</p>


<h2><a name="sec12" id="sec12"></a>
Again about hacker spaces</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">More discussion about having a space where people can hack</p>
</blockquote>

<p>PL: a hack  meeting space, like a fixed space  for meetings like 2600
in london and such.</p>

<p>K: we  once thought of  DMZ cafe,  a place with  a data center  in the
middle of  the room,  free internet but  a disclaimer: if  you connect
there is  people that might try  to hack you.  not really commercially
run, just an open cafe' and a good meeting point for hackers...</p>

<p>J: good to raise awareness about privacy</p>

<p>PL: still the economy needs to be  there to roll in, so you might want
to run also a  cafe. economy is not at the center  of the picture, but
should be in the picture.</p>


<h2><a name="sec13" id="sec13"></a>
About OLPC</h2>

<p class="first">The one laptop per child project and what we think about it</p>

<p>PL: OLPC is  an education project, in /tmp/lab we  like to develop for
both OLPC and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=EEEPC">EEEPC</a>, for us is basically the same. on OLPC we focus on
distribution,   awareness,    campaigning   with   local   government,
development of any kind of software, translation.</p>

<p>K:  i am  critical about  OLPC  educational approach:  kids can  learn
alphabet  on  books. in  schools  i  saw  kids forced  on  educational
programs and they were disgusted by machines..</p>

<p>J:  i'm also  critical about  the top-down  &quot;evangelical&quot;  approach of
OLPC.</p>

<p>PL: i agree, but you see: <a href="http://www.olpcfrance.org">we are mutating the project</a>, as we are local
people in  local place, 500  meters from one  of the poorest  areas of
france, one thing is important for us is to start acting practical and
just locally.  we  don't plan a tmp/lab everywhere  else in france, we
won't bring  our OLPC around, we just  want to show the  people in our
neighborhood  that  they can  do  the  same  and  mutate  further,  we
concentrate on being local.</p>

<p>J: so  you basically use and develop  it locally accepting it  as a de
facto existing infrastructure.</p>

<p>PL:  with any  kind of  project good  or bad  things will  happen, the
important question to be posed  is: enabling or disabling? ...anyway i
think OLPC will not be deployed  so much.  EEEPC will be deployed as a
real thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>J and K nod</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>J:  right. EEEPC  rocks:  that is  really  horizontal, no  need to  be
certified  by  academics in  USA  to have  a  prototype,  just go  buy
it.  sometimes  making  a  cheap  business distribution  is  way  more
democratic.</p>

<p>K: I  have another good  example of a  project with poor kids  here in
Indonesia: they  run a school, normal, afternoon  they run activities:
they  teach them  astronomy,  mechanics, computers...   those kind  of
projects i am  keen in participating.  they sponsor  kids that are not
really rich,  in the context of  schools, get them  involved in things
they might never  have a chance to get in  touch.  More experiences in
the  field  show  that  there  are many  limits  are  into  organizing
infrastructure.</p>


<h2><a name="sec14" id="sec14"></a>
Organization setups</h2>

<p class="first">PL: i use <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org">Trac as organization tool</a>, very effective, very important to
have such a  good tool for organizing.  I believe is  best to focus on
infrastructure instead  of specific projects: you never  know when the
energy is ready  to flow in which direction, so we'd  best try to open
the  space  (like  with a  wiki,  that  is  infinite)  and give  it  a
structure.  chaos can be destructive in these cases, we always need an
infrastructure for an ecosystem that is free..</p>

<p>K: you use wiki with the trac?</p>

<p>PL:  i  use all  features  of  trac:  wiki, ticketing  and  subversion
integration.</p>

<p>J: i also find trac very useful, we use it on dyne.org and it had made
much lighter  administration tasks. before  we used to  have moinmoin,
mantis and cvs which are  3 different systems all written in different
languages:  an  administration hassle.  Trac  merges  all  that.</p>


<h2><a name="sec15" id="sec15"></a>
Chitchat on wiki technologies</h2>

<p class="first">K: how trac is written?</p>

<p>J: python. good language for server side pages</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>everyone nods</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>J:  and i'm  very enthusiastic  about  emacs, org-mode  and muse.el  -
client side <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=CMS">CMS</a>.</p>

<p>PL: yes, but what about collective wikis and collective CMS?</p>

<p>J: <a href="http://lab.dyne.org">lab.dyne.org</a> runs on heavy load <a href="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/">moin-moin</a> wiki. holds well.</p>

<p>PL:  true.   i   tried  quite  some  wiki  engines   and  moinmoin  is
good. mediawiki sucks,  <a href="http://www.pmwiki.org">pmwiki</a> way better: stores pages  as flat files
and upgrading it is as simple  as detaring the new version in the root
of   the  pmwiki   install.   That's   good   technological  fluidity.</p>

<p>J: ahah. agree. mediawiki sucks :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>My laptop battery finishes, minutes get less precise</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We talk about P2P technologies, telephone network, hacking of existing
mobile phones (and how little has been done so far in that direction),
the bricophone project and more...</p>


<h2><a name="sec16" id="sec16"></a>
Jim arrives</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>Jim joins us wearing a t-shirt: &quot;because ninjas are too busy.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>J2: Hi all.</p>

<p>PL: Jim is doing electronic music and is a computer expert.</p>

<p>J: we were now discussing about P2P. (<em>quick resume of the meeting</em>)</p>

<p>J2: I like p2p in relation to worm networks :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>more discussion about how worms nowadays work and communicate</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>J: Jim you should check the Cellsbutton festival in Jogja organized by
HONF, i guess you'd be a good presence there, performing maybe.</p>

<p>J2: never heard about, interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>more discussion lacking notes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>J:  something i  didn't mentioned  yet is  <a href="http://www.transmission.cc">Transmission.cc</a>,  Andy from
<a href="http://engagemedia.org">engagemedia</a>  is organizing  the  asian edition  of  this meeting  this
summer in  collaboration with <a href="http://ruangrupa.org">RuangRupa</a>. Meeting  is about independent
TV station, very important topic  here. Was first organized in Rome at
Forte Prenestino, then London, then  Amsterdam a few weeks ago .. next
here.</p>
