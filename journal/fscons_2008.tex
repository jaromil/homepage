\Topic {Piracy vs Neo-Colonialism}

\startquotation
Piracy does not simply  exist because there are bloody-minded people
who don't  care for the  rules and laws  of the civilised  world. It
tends to  emerge whenever  there is a  hegemonic power  that asserts
itself by  establishing a  trade monopoly. ({\em Armin Medosh})
\stopquotation

\startquotation
During the first decades of America's existence as a nation, private
citizens,   voluntary   associations,   and   government   officials
encouraged the smuggling of  European inventions and artisans to the
New World.  These actions  openly violated the intellectual property
regimes  of  European  nations. ({\em Doron Ben-Altar})
\stopquotation




\Topic {At the End of Capitalism}

\startitemize
\item Is it DOOM for content  creators?

\item How is  unrestricted copying anything but a  bane for people trying
to make a living while making media?

\item Is there something as a {\bf Peer to Peer Economy}?

\item Think about it.

\item It is {\bf not} barter. Micro-payments maybe help.

\item Think TWICE!

\item Imagine {\bf local economies}. Connect them.

\item Let the people join. Give broad access to production.

\item Redistribute the activity.  Let neighbours take care of each other.

\item Dis-corporate production. {\bf REP RAP}.
\stopitemize


\Topic {The Rise of new Values}

\startitemize
\item {\bf Refuse Scarcity}. Abundance is not our enemy, it is our friend.

\item {\bf Refuse   the  Big  Success},   the  Big  Audience,  the   Big  Mass
Media. Connect  specific communities with  low-cost and low-latency
distribution

\item {\bf Refuse the Broadcast  Quality}. Embrace modesty, publish unfinished,
involve  people,  work   enthusiastically  with  what's  available.
Follow the vector of quality, don't pursue its mirage.

\item {\bf Recycle!} modular architectures, generic infrastuctures.

\item RE-USE! {\bf BRICO BRICO}
