<h1>Piet Zwart media design students 2008</h1>    
<p>In the last trimester of 2008 I've been active as a tutor for students
of both first and second year of the Media Design MA at the Piet Zwart
institute in Rotterdam.  It has  been the occasion to develop a course
for design students keen to engage the geeky world of GNU/Linux :) and
the social and architectural visions  it can inspire. The course (96h)
is titled &quot;<a href="pz_mdma_2008.html">The  Art, Theory &amp; Techniques of Free  Software</a>&quot; and at its
current  implementation at PZ  it posed  the goals  of writing  a 4000
words  essay in  english plus  the realisation  of a  net-art project.</p>

<p>Earlier this year,  reconfirmed for 2009, I've held  a reduced version
of this course (24h) for the &quot;Digital Environmental Design&quot; MA program
at the Nuova  Accademia delle Belle Arti in  Milano, Italy, invited by
its director Paolo Atzori.</p>

<p>The  engaging curricular  scheme  planned by  course director  Florian
Cramer  has inspired us  to spend  one third  of the  course exploring
various topics, spanning from the variety of the programming languages
to the  design of digital public space,  object oriented architectures
and the  importance that privacy  and horizontal access to  media have
for democracy.</p>

<p>Thanks to the contribution  of other colleagues Michael, Calum Selkirk
and the media theory lectures  held by Florian himself, i believe this
class represents  a memorable  experience for the  students, improving
their technical as well critical skills in dealing with on-line media.</p>

<p>During  the  second  third  of  this course  the  students  have  been
encouraged to focus on a more specific topic and develop it in the two
aforementioned forms, to challenge their theoretical as well practical
skills.</p>

<p>At  the beginning of  the last  third of  this course  an overwhelming
media   attention  has   been   dedicated  to   the  student   project
<a href="http://pirates-of-the-amazon.com">Pirates of the Amazon</a>, which might justify the curiosity of the reader
until here.   I find it  appropriate now to  give a panoramic  on some
other productions  that have been presented  at the end  of the course
and which have well elaborated on the concepts we have discussed.</p>

<h3>The End of Google</h3>

<h4>Thematic project by Dennis de Bel</h4>

<p class="first">This project elaborates an explicit  parody on the authority of Google
Search  ranking  algorithm  offering  the possibility  to  revert  its
calculation, placing the least valued  links in the first place on top
of its results.</p>

<p>After years  of success  servicing heuristic information  to worldwide
Internet users,  the omnipresence  of Google for  our web  searches is
scary to  some and even  scholarly questioned.  What in  reality looks
like a neutral evaluation and  attribution of popularity might just be
relative to  a point of view:  the spectre of  a subjective evaluation
becomes  a worrying  doubt for  those who  consider it  a totalitarian
monopoly on information.</p>

<p>While it  still serves well  our purposes, setting an  higher standard
for  our  web  navigation  and  a growing  number  of  Internet  based
services, Google's hegemony of sense is turned upside down by a simple
web-scraping algorithm built in  a web browser extension, distributing
its &quot;reverse computation&quot; to the clients.</p>

<p>This project, and  other projects as Google Random?,  suggest that the
democratic spirit of  Google's policies and its &quot;we  do no evil&quot; motto
could  lead to  open its  final and  most obscure  secret,  the search
rating  algorithm, opening  it  as in  the  case of  its other  public
services. By offering a &quot;Google Search API&quot; for its users to customise
search results  and match the variety of  possible evaluations, Google
can reply  threatening criticisms  with a fresh  addition to  its user
interface,  democratically  empowering  humans  to interact  with  the
majestic power of its machine  brain, for the noble sake of relativity
of views.</p>




<h3>Yes To All</h3>

<h4>Thematic project by Selena Savic</h4>

<p class="first">YES TO ALL offers an humorous commentary on the condescending habit of
contemporary netizens to click-sign contracts on websites.</p>

<p>Complementary to  Linda Hilfling's recent artist  in residence project
&quot;Gate  Peepin&quot; realised  this year  at  <a href="http://www.nimk.nl/en">NIMK</a>, the  project focuses  on
common  web-forms  that  captivate  semi-conscious agreements  of  web
visitors to  all kinds of pretentiously official  contracts: a browser
extension  is then  provided  to turn  all  these input  forms into  a
uniform  and repetitive &quot;yes  to all&quot;,  emphasising the  numb attitude
most  people assumes  when  confronted with  web  2.0 licenses,  input
dialogs  and  signature  widgets  that are  ultimately  holding  users
responsible for such semi-automated choices.</p>

<p>Yes to All is a sharp and sarcastic representation of the contemporary
state  of web-interaction, suggesting  that in  a plausible  future we
might  regret having  said YES  so often  that we  cannot  even recall
anymore in which occasion and what for.</p>
