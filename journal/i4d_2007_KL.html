Introduction</h2>

<p class="first">This  report  was commissioned  by  <a href="http://www.idrc.ca">IDRC</a>  and  is released  under  the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=GNU%20Free%20Documentation%20License">GNU Free Documentation License</a> with no invariant parts.</p>

<p>I was  involved in the  i4d festival, at  the GK3 conference,  to lend
expertise for the video workshop, facilitated by Rana Ghose, which was
held in  Kuala Lumpur  (Malaysia), on 10  December 2007,  organised by
<a href="http://www.csdms.in">CSDMS</a>.</p>

<p>The motivation to participate  in this initiative, was the possibility
to share with participants  from developing countries, knowledge about
FOSS  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Free%20Open%20Source%20%20Software">Free Open Source Software</a>) for  multimedia creativity,  in the
belief that adoption  of FOSS widens access to  technology by offering
ways  to  recycle  existing  infrastructures, and  therefore  lowering
financial  requirements for cultural  production, where  technology is
required.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a remarkable  positive effect of the adoption  of FOSS in
such contexts lies in  providing an autonomous pattern of development:
tools that  are free to be  copied, shared, modified  and even resold,
both locally  and globally, among communities, foster  the creation of
self sustainable  economies. Last but not  least I was  excited by the
idea  of collaborating  with Rana  Ghose,  an activist  whose work  is
inspiring for my own  reflection about priorities and methods employed
in our initiatives.</p>


<p>For my  own contribution I  adopted the GNU/Linux  LiveCD distribution
<a href="http://dynebolic.org">dyne:bolic</a>,  which   I'm  maintaining,  with  the  help   of  a  broad
grass-roots community. The main reason  for its adoption is the unique
set of  features, not found  in any other GNU/Linux  distributions, as
well the  presence of all software applications  needed for multimedia
creativity in one  CD, and the fact that  the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">Free Software Foundation</a>
recommends and  mirrors this distribution as  the GNU/Linux multimedia
creation tool.</p>



<h2><a name="sec2" id="sec2"></a>
Workshop</h2>

<p class="first">A total of 22 participants,  expressed a specific interest in learning
how  to produce  video, and  later  empower their  community with  the
skills  we were  sharing. They  were a  privileged group  -  very well
equipped   with  fast  personal   computers,  and   recently  marketed
audio/video  devices, and  most of  them had  basic skills  in desktop
usage and media production.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="fotos/i4d-2007/i4d-video-workshop-1.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The  workshop was hosted  with a  well equipped  set-up, there  was no
technical need left  unsatisfied, and the lunch break  was at the same
time pleasant  and practical, with  delicious food provided in  a room
adjacent to the workshop room.</p>

<p>The  production of  video documentation  being the  main focus  of the
workshop, participants  were approached so that the  complexity of the
task  would be  blended with  the  familiarity and  simplicity of  the
software  applications  adopted.   Microsoft's  product  Movie  Maker,
present by default in the XP and Vista operating systems, was the most
familiar platform, and therefore Rana led the video-making part of the
workshop referring to it, while I  did my best to refer people to FOSS
alternatives  that could  efficiently and  easily accomplish  the same
tasks.</p>

<p>An  approach  like the  above  is  made  necessary by  the  widespread
adoption  of proprietary  software  in video-making  and its  advanced
stage of  development at this point  in time. It is  important to take
into account what people are used  to, when training people, if we are
to introduce them to FOSS.</p>

<p>I found this mild collaboration between well known proprietary systems
and not-yet  ready FOSS  software a good  approach at  present, mostly
focusing   on   empowering   people   with   operational   skills   in
mission-critical developing environments, rather than frustrating them
with  current limits  of FOSS  in video  editing. On  the basis  of my
experience and  the perception  of needs raised  by this  workshop, my
rough prediction is that in  18 months from now FOSS applications like
Open Movie  Editor or  KDEnLive can completely  substitute proprietary
solutions,  and  I'm  personally  looking  forward to  re-run  such  a
workshop based completely on FOSS. My presence as a FOSS expert raised
a good level of interest: at least 4 participants were already used to
GNU/Linux (but didn't have it installed on their PCs), a larger number
of them  had heard  about it  and were curious  to know  more, showing
enthusiasm  for  its  philosophy  and grass-roots  approach.  In  this
workshop I've taken the opportunity, to briefly show the range of FOSS
multimedia   applications   available,  and   provide   an  easy   and
non-intrusive  way to  run  GNU/Linux besides  the existing  operating
system.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="fotos/i4d-2007/livecd_manufacturing.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Free copies of  dyne:bolic liveCD were made on the  spot, and while no
merchandising  is available  for dyne  products, the  value of  a hand
written CD is always well appreciated, and makes people feel closer to
the possibility of doing it themselves. As each participant received a
CD, he or she was encouraged to copy it, modify it and even sell it at
will: this aspect of FOSS is  often neglected even if it is crucial to
define the wide  boundaries of its freedom, so  I found it appropriate
to  mention  that   it  can  be  copied  and   sold  to  create  local
economies. When related to pirate economies like DVD copying of movies
and their specific support to weaker contexts in societies, it becomes
clear that this  aspect of FOSS can be of great  importance, and I did
my best to elaborate more on the topic in the i4d film festival panel.</p>

<p>Unfortunately,  the limited amount  of time  available didn't  made it
possible to  explore multimedia production with FOSS,  as priority was
given  to Rana's  video-making training,  which was  not all  based on
software  usage, but  mostly  on practical  notions  of camera  usage,
interview techniques  and organization of  content.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="fotos/i4d-2007/i4d-video-workshop-2.jpg" alt=""></p>




<h2><a name="sec3" id="sec3"></a>
Panel</h2>

<p class="first">The panel was well assembled, with actual issues regarding production,
distribution and  sustainability of independent  and grass-roots video
making initiatives in Asia.</p>


<p>Documentation of the panel  is hereby provided in multiple recordings:
one for each  speaker plus the final debate  with the public, download
is available at the following URL:</p>

<p><a href="http://jaromil.dyne.org/journal/sounds/i4d-KL2007-panel/">http://jaromil.dyne.org/journal/sounds/i4d-KL2007-panel/</a></p>

<p>As a compendium to my  intervention, please refer to the documentation
about &quot;privacy  and piracy&quot; referring  to the speech I  delivered this
year at the Ars Electronica Festival symposium GOODBYE PRIVACY</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://jaromil.dyne.org/journal/piracy_privacy.html">http://jaromil.dyne.org/journal/piracy_privacy.html</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bricolabs.net/directions/goodbye_privacy">http://bricolabs.net/directions/goodbye_privacy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.thenextlayer.org/GoodbyePrivacy">http://www.thenextlayer.org/GoodbyePrivacy</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The  chairperson of the  panel Mirta  Lourenco (UNESCO  media capacity
building section) expressed her  interest in addressing explicitly the
political and  economical implications of  piracy I've raised:  at the
moment  I'm hopeful  that  organisations present  at  the panel,  will
elaborate on such issues in their agendas, in order to raise awareness
and  find solutions  which will  challenge the  worldwide  tendency to
blindly criminalise such social phenomenons.</p>


<h2><a name="sec4" id="sec4"></a>
Technical notes</h2>

<p class="first">Adoption  of the dyne:bolic  GNU/Linux liveCD  was impossible  on most
recent laptop  PCs because of  incompatible video devices  equipped on
them:  this is a  common problem  for Linux  and X  software platforms
since the  early beginning of their  distribution, due to  the lack of
hardware specifications openly  released for independent developers by
the  manufacturers of  graphical  adaptors. Still  the FOSS  community
keeps faith  in a better  future for generic  compatibility especially
considering the steps recently taken by ATI and Intel companies.</p>

<p>Problems were  often occurring on participants  PCs (3 or  4) that had
installed the  newest Microsoft Windows Vista  operating system, which
showed  several  instability  issues  and  an  unnatural  slowness  of
operations when compared to its predecessor XP.</p>

<p>At  least 2  participants had  difficulties with  Sony  harddisk video
cameras: it was impossible to  edit the recorded video on both Windows
and GNU/Linux platforms, plus  the proprietary and incompatible format
of memory cards was making it impossible to interface the devices with
generic mass memory readers.</p>


<h2><a name="sec5" id="sec5"></a>
Conclusion</h2>

<p class="first">As a  conclusion I set an  aim for my coming  research and development
activities  to provide  Rana (as  a brilliant  model  for video-making
trainers) with FOSS tools to fill the gap of the video-editing part of
his workshop where  he is still forced to  employ proprietary tools by
the lack of reliable FOSS alternatives.</p>

<p>My  gratitude for  this  experience goes  to Sulakshana  Bhattacharya,
Prashant Gupta, Graham Todd and of course Rana Ghose.</p>
